## Introduction

With Shuffle being Open Source, there is a need for a place to read about configuration. There are quite a few options, and this article aims to delve into those.

Shuffle is based on Docker and is started using docker-compose with configuration items in a .env file. .env has the configuration items to be used for default environment changes, database locations, port forwarding, github locations and more.

## Installation

Check out the [installation guide](https://github.com/frikky/shuffle/blob/master/.github/install-guide.md), however if you're on linux:

System requirements may be found further down in the [Servers](#servers) section.

```
git clone https://github.com/shuffle/Shuffle
cd Shuffle
docker-compose up -d
```

### Updating Shuffle

`From version v1.1 onwards, we are using ghcr.io/shuffle/* registry instead of ghcr.io/frikky/*`

As long as you use Docker, updating Shuffle is straight forward. To use a specific version of Shuffle, check out [specific version](/docs/configuration#specific-versioning). We recommend always sticking to the `latest` tag, and if you want experimental changes, use the `nightly` tag. You may however in specific cases want to use a static tag, such as `2.1.1`

While being in the main repository, here is how to update Shuffle:

```
docker-compose down
git pull
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```
**Please note:**
We will no longer provide support for older versions after **January 31, 2026**. To ensure uninterrupted access and the best possible experience, please upgrade to **Shuffle v2.1.1**.

Versions v2.1.1+ include strict, enforced limitations. We are now actively enforcing the differences between the [Open Source (OSS) and Enterprise editions](https://shuffler.io/articles/Open_Source_vs_Enterprise), differences that have always existed but were not previously enforced.

**PS: This will NOT update your apps, meaning they may be outdated. To update your apps, go to /apps and click both buttons in the top right corner (reload apps locally & Download from Github)**

### Specific Versioning

To use a specific version of Shuffle, you'll need to manually edit the Docker-Compose.yml file to reflect the version - usually for the frontend and backend, but sometimes also the other containers. You can [see all our released versions here](https://github.com/orgs/Shuffle/packages). We recommend keeping the same version for the frontend and backend, and **not** to keep them separate, as seen in the image below.

### Marketplace Setup

Using cloud marketplaces ([AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/), [Google Cloud Marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace), [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/)), you should be able to deploy Shuffle onprem with a few clicks. This is a great way to get started with Shuffle, as it's a fully managed service and test it out in your own environment without worrying about the setup. We are working with our cloud partners to get this up and running as soon as possible.

## Server configuration

Shuffle is by default configured to be easy to start using. This means we have had to make some tradeoffs which can be enabled/disabled to make it easier to use, or scale better. The following section outlines a lot of what is necessary to make Shuffle's security, availability and scalability better.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bf288e0-fbd7-47c1-aba2-5269acaa4f8d)

**Here are the things we'll dive into**
- [Environment Variables](#environment_variables)
- [High Availability](#high-availability)

### Environment Variables
With Shuffle being a very technical system, it is important to understand that you have a lot of control mechanisms available to you in your local installation.

[Check the .env file on your server](https://github.com/Shuffle/Shuffle/blob/main/.env) to see what the default values are. They are broadly split into the following:

- Setup Configuration (default usernames & download locations for easy deployments)
- Network Configuration (e.g. how does the frontend route to the correct backend, or Orborus->Frontend->Backend through Nginx)
- Container Control (Registries, Docker & K8s-specific configs etc.)
- Health and Stability (Enable/Disable health checks, Log forwarding, automatic Reruns and Aborts etc.)
- Opensearch Configuration (Networking, password & security systems etc)

**PS:** Most of our environment variables start with `SHUFFLE_`

### Servers
When setting up Shuffle for production, we always recommend two or more servers (VMs), but it works fine with one to start. These are MINIMUM requirements, and we recommend adding more to avoid congestion.

The webserver is where your users and Shuffle's API is. Opensearch is a RAM heavy database, and we are doing A LOT of caching with to ensure scalable stability.

- Services: Frontend, Backend, Orborus, Opensearch (All)
- CPU: 2vCPU
- RAM: 8Gb
- Disk: >100Gb (SSD)

The [default docker-compose file](https://github.com/shuffle/Shuffle/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) works well to scale on a single server.

### Hybrid Cloud Configuration

* Onprem: If you want to try using Hybrid Shuffle, see [Cloud sync documentation](/docs/organizations#cloud_synchronization)
* Cloud: If you want access to on-premises resources and API's, [set up extra Environments](/docs/organizations#environments)

### High Availability
When running Shuffle on multiple servers, you need to take multiple things into account. Among them are:
- Can the servers talk to each other?
- Do you want all Shuffle services on all servers?
- Do you want distributed storage?
- Do you already have a cluster, or does it need to be made?
- Do you want Docker or Kubernetes? Or containerless?

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5248417c-c47b-4397-95c5-b01e1f5b4082)

Here is a breakdown of the previous High Availability image of Shuffle, and how it works:
1. All the **Green** colored services are our providers, meaning they are built by someone else than Shuffle, but used in the Shuffle stack. Here is our recommendation on scaling these services:
   * [Opensearch (Database)](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/tuning-your-cluster/). Elasticsearch also works. If you are using more than one entrypoint to Opensearch/Elasticsearch, [add the URL's comma separated in the .env file](https://github.com/Shuffle/Shuffle/blob/c5ef50f523c041efaf53a1e285c1b19a30201e67/.env#L104).
   * [Memcached (Shared Memory)](#distributed_caching): We recommend starting with Memcached on a single server, and only scaling up as needed. Shuffle can run without it, but when scaling runtime locations it gives the Backend, Orborus and Workers a shared cache instead of separate process-local caches. Add multiple [comma separated URL's here](https://github.com/Shuffle/Shuffle/blob/c5ef50f523c041efaf53a1e285c1b19a30201e67/.env#L84) to configure multiple instances.

2. **NFS** is Network File Storage. This is for you to be able to store files across multiple servers. This is required if you are running multiple instances of the Shuffle backend, and for them to have consistent access to the Files that you store. Only configure this if you are storing files in Shuffle. When NFS is set up, [mount your NFS storage to ./shuffle-files](https://github.com/Shuffle/Shuffle/blob/c5ef50f523c041efaf53a1e285c1b19a30201e67/docker-compose.yml#L28).

3. The **Blue** services are YOUR services. These can be in your Cloud, Onprem etc. The service in Shuffle that needs access to this are the `Apps`, which have their network configuration copied from the `Orborus` container. If you have on-premises services that Shuffle needs access to, set up an Orborus instance in the same network, which has access to your Shuffle instance + the service in question.

4. The **orange** services are Shuffle's containers. Below is a breakdown of what and how to use them.
* **Backend:** Handles all of Shuffle's API requests, and are typically routed through the Frontend service. This means that it usually does NOT expose a port. **Scale across ALL available servers.** Available on shuffle-http://backend:5001 in the container network.
* **Frontend:** Handles frontend & backend routing, as well as the default certificates. **Scale across ALL available servers.** Available on http://shuffle-frontend:3001 or https://shuffle-frontend:3443 in the container network.
* **Orborus / Worker / Apps:** Orborus is in charge of this stack, and is how you control all three services. Orborus receives jobs from the Backend, and does NOT expose any port. Read more about configuring, scaling and managing them in your instance on the [/admin?tab=locations](/admin?tab=locations) page, or in the next section.

### Scaling Runtime Locations
Orborus can run in Docker-swarm mode, and in early 2023, with Kubernetes. This makes the workflow executions **A LOT** faster, use less resources, making it more scalable both on a single, as well as across multiple servers. Since September 2024, scale has been partially open source, and can be achieved with changing environment variables in the "Orborus" container for Shuffle. [Click here for Kubernetes details](https://github.com/Shuffle/Shuffle/tree/2.0.0/functions/kubernetes#instructions). If you have received a licensed version, don't forget step 3 to load in the correct worker.

Let's begin with setting up Docker, Docker Compose, and creating a Docker Swarm network with two manager nodes involves several steps. Below is a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

**Step 1: Install Docker**

Install Docker on both machines by following the official Docker installation guide for your operating system.
Docker Installation Guide: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

**Step 2: Install Docker Compose**

Install Docker Compose on both machines by following the official Docker Compose installation guide.
Docker Compose Installation Guide: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

Step 3: Load the license **(skip if not a customer)**

You should have received a license from the Shuffle team, which comes in form of a URL. This URL can be used to download the licensed version of the Worker as many times as you want. After downloading it, you need to docker load the file.
```
wget <url>
docker load -i shuffle-worker.zip
```

After these have been ran, it should be clear what the docker image is. This docker image needs to be used in the `SHUFFLE_WORKER_IMAGE` environment variable in step 4.

**Step 4: Configure Orborus Environment Variables:**
1. Add and change the following environment variables for Orborus in the docker-compose.yml file. `BASE_URL` is the external URL of the server you're running Shuffle on (the one you visit Shuffle with in your browser):
```
# Required:
- SHUFFLE_SWARM_CONFIG=run      # Enables SWARM scaling
- SHUFFLE_LOGS_DISABLED=true    # Ensures we don't have memory issues
- BASE_URL=http://YOUR-BACKEND-IP:3001   # replaced by the backend's public IP
- SHUFFLE_WORKER_IMAGE=ghcr.io/shuffle/shuffle-worker:latest

# Optional configuration:
- SHUFFLE_AUTO_IMAGE_DOWNLOAD=false                       # This should be set to false IF images are already downloaded
# Please use the correct ports for SHUFFLE_WORKER_SERVER_URL when using a custom URL.
# Else, we simply default to port 80 if no port is mentioned (Note: the default shuffle-workers URL is treated a bit
# differently than other custom URLs. Shuffle automatically appends the right port to it on the fly unlike other custom URLs)
- SHUFFLE_WORKER_SERVER_URL=http://shuffle-workers        # Internal Docker Worker URL (don't modify if not necessary)
- SHUFFLE_SWARM_NETWORK_NAME=shuffle_swarm_executions     # If you want a special network name in the executions
- SHUFFLE_SCALE_REPLICAS=1                                # The amount of worker container replicas PER NODE  (since 1.2.0)
- SHUFFLE_APP_REPLICAS=1                                  # The amount of app container replicas PER NODE     (since 1.2.1)
- SHUFFLE_MAX_SWARM_NODES=1                               # The max amount of swarm nodes shuffle can use     (since 1.3.2)
- SHUFFLE_SKIPSSL_VERIFY=true                             # Stops Shuffle's internal services from validating TLS/SSL certificates. Good to use if BASE_URL is a domain.

```

If this is configured properly, the "Status" and "Scale" section on your [Runtime Locations in the Admin panel](https://shuffler.io/admin?tab=locations) should show as "Running" and a green checkmark respectively.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fbfdf29-0a3f-4926-bf93-da70226e30b1)

To make swarm work, Please make sure that [these ports are open](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/#open-protocols-and-ports-between-the-hosts) on all your machines (to at least, both of these machines internally): 2377, 7946 and 4789

**It is recommended to make sure that these ports are ONLY open internally to be sure that everything is secure.**

2. When step 1 is configured, take down the stack and pull it back up AFTER initializing swarm:
```
docker swarm init
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
docker swarm join-token manager # copy the command given
```

PS: In certain scenarios you may need extra configurations, e.g. for network MTU's, docker download locations, proxies etc. See more in the [production readiness](/docs/configuration#production_readiness) section.

### Adding another machine to the swarm network:

Start by making sure docker works here. Then paste the output from the previous docker command to `docker join`. It adds the network in the docker swarm network as a manager (It is required to orchestrate the app containers).

It should look something like this:

```
docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-{token} {internal IP}:2377
```

### Verify swarm

Run the following command to get logs from Orborus:

```
docker logs -f shuffle-orborus
```

And to check if services have started:

```
docker service ls
```

If the list is empty, or you see any of the "replicas" have 0/1, then something is wrong. In case of any swarm issues, contact us at [support@shuffler.io](mailto:support@shuffler.io) or contact your account representative.

If you get EOFs or timeouts for workers in machine B, look [here](https://shuffler.io/docs/troubleshooting#TLS_timeout_error/Timeout_Errors/EOF_Errors).

![](Aspose.Words.81096d25-bbff-47b2-a5ee-1ac38ad8ca4e.001.jpeg)

### Swarm: Manual worker service (Orborus scheduler-only)
If you want Orborus to only schedule jobs while you manage workers as a Swarm service yourself, you can pre-create the `shuffle-workers` service and point Orborus at it. Orborus will still poll the backend queue and send execution requests to `/api/v1/execute`.

1. Create the overlay network (if not already created):
```
docker network create --driver=overlay --attachable shuffle_swarm_executions
```

2. Create the worker service manually:
```
docker service create \
  --name shuffle-workers \
  --replicas 3 \
  --network shuffle_swarm_executions \
  --publish published=33333,target=33333 \
  --env SHUFFLE_SWARM_CONFIG=run \
  --env SHUFFLE_MEMCACHED=shuffle-memcached:11211 \
  ghcr.io/shuffle/shuffle-worker:latest
```

3. Deploy `shuffle-orborus` after the worker service exists so the first execution can dispatch immediately.

4. Configure Orborus to use the manual worker service:
```
- SHUFFLE_SWARM_CONFIG=run
- SHUFFLE_WORKER_SERVER_URL=http://shuffle-workers:33333
- SHUFFLE_SWARM_NETWORK_NAME=shuffle_swarm_executions
- CLEANUP=false
- SHUFFLE_LOGS_DISABLED=true
```

5. Ensure Orborus is attached to the same overlay network as `shuffle-workers`.

**Limitations and gotchas**
- Orborus still calls the Docker Swarm API (service list/create, network attach). It must run with manager-level Docker API access (direct socket or a socket proxy that exposes swarm/service/network endpoints).
- Workers also need manager-level Docker API access to deploy app services during executions; without it, app execution fails.
- If `shuffle-workers` is deleted or scaled to 0, Orborus will try to recreate it and may fail if it lacks permissions.
- If the worker service is not reachable as `shuffle-workers:33333`, execution requests will fail. Use `SHUFFLE_WORKER_SERVER_URL` to point to the correct DNS/port.

### Environment Variables

Shuffle has a few toggles that makes it straight up faster, but which removes a lot of the checks that are being done during your first tries of Shuffle.

Backend:

```
# Set the encryption key to ensure all app authentication is being encrypted. If this is NOT defined, we do not encrypt your apps. If this is defined, all authentications - both old and new will start using this key.
# Do NOT lose this key if specified, as that means you will need to reset all keys.

SHUFFLE_ENCRYPTION_MODIFIER=YOUR KEY HERE

# **PS: Encryption is available from Shuffle backend version >=0.9.17.**
# **PPS: There's a [known bug](https://github.com/frikky/Shuffle/issues/528) with Proxies and git**

# Set up distributed memcaching. See "Distributed Caching" for more.
SHUFFLE_MEMCACHED=<IP>:PORT

```

Orborus:

```
# Cleans up all containers after they're done. Necessary to help Docker scale. Default=false
CLEANUP=true

# Cleans up any containers related to Shuffle that have been up for more than 600 seconds.
SHUFFLE_ORBORUS_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT=600

# Decides the max amount of workflows to concurrenly run. Defaults to 10.
# Example math: 10 workflows * WITH 10 apps / second = 110 containers per second.
# We recommend starting with 10 and going higher as need be.
SHUFFLE_ORBORUS_EXECUTION_CONCURRENCY=10

# Configures a HTTP proxy to use when talking to the Shuffle Backend
HTTP_PROXY=
# Configures a HTTPS proxy when speaking to the Shuffle Backend
HTTPS_PROXY=

# Set to true to pass HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY/NO_PROXY from Orborus to Worker
SHUFFLE_PASS_WORKER_PROXY=true

# Set to true to pass HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY/NO_PROXY from Worker to Apps
SHUFFLE_PASS_APP_PROXY=false


### PAID: The environment variables below only work when you've acquired a paid license of Shuffle (not required, but VERY useful when scaling Shuffle):
SHUFFLE_WORKER_IMAGE=ghcr.io/shuffle/shuffle-worker-scale:latest
SHUFFLE_SWARM_NETWORK_NAME=shuffle_swarm_executions
SHUFFLE_SCALE_REPLICAS=1
SHUFFLE_SWARM_CONFIG=run

# Set up distributed caching for Orborus & Worker(s). See "Distributed Caching" for more.
SHUFFLE_MEMCACHED=<IP>:PORT
```

### Distributed Caching
Once you have a scalable version of Shuffle, using Docker Swarm or Kubernetes, it becomes important for short-lived execution data to be visible across services. Shuffle supports distributed caching [in the form of Memcached](https://hub.docker.com/_/memcached). Memcached helps reduce database load and gives runtime-location components a shared cache while workers are deployed and executions are updated.

- Backend
- Orborus
- Worker

The database remains the source of truth. Memcached is used for cache keys such as execution data, action results, validation data, health/stat counters and worker coordination. If `SHUFFLE_MEMCACHED` is empty, each service falls back to its own local in-memory cache.

To make use of Memcached, start a Memcached service on a host or service network Shuffle can access, then configure each service to use it with `SHUFFLE_MEMCACHED`. The default port is 11211. Here is a quickstart that reserves 1024 Mb of memory:
```
docker run --name shuffle-cache -p 11211:11211 -d memcached -m 1024
```

**PS: This requires swap limit capabilities on the Docker host. [More about running it in Docker here](https://hub.docker.com/_/memcached)**

Once this is up, it will be listening on port 11211. From here, set `SHUFFLE_MEMCACHED` on the Backend and Orborus. Orborus forwards the same value into workers it starts, including single Docker workers, the `shuffle-workers` Swarm service and Kubernetes worker deployments. Here's an example that fits into your docker-compose file:
```
services:
  shuffle-backend:
    image: ghcr.io/shuffle/shuffle-backend:latest
    environment:
      - SHUFFLE_MEMCACHED=10.0.0.1:11211
      ...

```

Set the same value on Orborus:
```
services:
  orborus:
    image: ghcr.io/shuffle/shuffle-orborus:latest
    environment:
      - SHUFFLE_MEMCACHED=10.0.0.1:11211
      ...
```

You can additionally add this to your docker compose with the following setting:
```
  memcached:
    image: memcached:latest
    container_name: shuffle-cache
    hostname: shuffle-cache
    mem_limit: 1024m
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - MEMCACHED_MEMORY=1024
      - MEMCACHED_MAX_CONNECTIONS=2500
    ports:
      - 11211:11211
```

### Memcached on a Docker Swarm network
When running with `SHUFFLE_SWARM_CONFIG=run`, Memcached must be reachable from the worker network. Orborus creates or uses the overlay network from `SHUFFLE_SWARM_NETWORK_NAME`, and workers use that network when they execute workflows. If Memcached only exists on the main Shuffle network, workers may fail to resolve or connect to it.

You do not need to expose Memcached on the host machine for this setup. Do not add `-p 11211:11211`, `--publish`, or a Compose `ports:` entry unless something outside Docker must connect to Memcached. For Shuffle Swarm, keep Memcached internal and use `tasks.shuffle-cache:11211` from services attached to the overlay network.

The common pattern is:

* Backend reaches Memcached on the main Shuffle network.
* Orborus reaches Memcached and forwards `SHUFFLE_MEMCACHED` to workers.
* Workers reach Memcached on the execution overlay network.

Attach Memcached to both networks if backend and workers are not on the same overlay:
```
docker network create --driver=overlay --attachable shuffle
docker network create --driver=overlay --attachable shuffle_swarm_executions

docker service create \
  --name shuffle-cache \
  --network shuffle \
  --network shuffle_swarm_executions \
  --replicas 1 \
  --endpoint-mode dnsrr \
  memcached:1.6-alpine \
  -m 1024 -c 2048
```

Then set the same endpoint on backend and Orborus:
```
- SHUFFLE_MEMCACHED=tasks.shuffle-cache:11211
```

If you manage the worker service manually, attach it to the same execution network:
```
docker service create \
  --name shuffle-workers \
  --network shuffle_swarm_executions \
  --env SHUFFLE_SWARM_CONFIG=run \
  --env SHUFFLE_MEMCACHED=tasks.shuffle-cache:11211 \
  ghcr.io/shuffle/shuffle-worker:latest
```

For a Swarm stack file, the important parts look like this:
```
services:
  shuffle-cache:
    image: memcached:1.6-alpine
    command: ["-m", "1024", "-c", "2048"]
    networks:
      - shuffle
      - shuffle_swarm_executions
    deploy:
      replicas: 1
      endpoint_mode: dnsrr

  shuffle-backend:
    environment:
      - SHUFFLE_MEMCACHED=tasks.shuffle-cache:11211
    networks:
      - shuffle

  orborus:
    environment:
      - SHUFFLE_SWARM_CONFIG=run
      - SHUFFLE_SWARM_NETWORK_NAME=shuffle_swarm_executions
      - SHUFFLE_MEMCACHED=tasks.shuffle-cache:11211
    networks:
      - shuffle
      - shuffle_swarm_executions

networks:
  shuffle:
    driver: overlay
    attachable: true
  shuffle_swarm_executions:
    driver: overlay
    attachable: true
```

Verify connectivity from a temporary container on the execution network:
```
docker run --rm --network shuffle_swarm_executions alpine sh -c "apk add --no-cache busybox-extras >/dev/null && nc -vz tasks.shuffle-cache 11211"
```

### Multi-server memcached
You can run Memcached on multiple servers as well, but may run into key inconsistency if clients do not route the same key to the same server. This should however not affect how things run in Shuffle, as we verify and fix request data. To do this, add multiple Memcached instances to the environment variable, comma separated.

Example:
```
- SHUFFLE_MEMCACHED=10.0.0.1:11211,10.0.0.2:11211,10.0.0.3:11211
```

If you need help with this, [please contact us](mailto:support@shuffler.io).

### Disaster Recovery/High Availability

In a production system within a high-criticality environment concerning requirements and security, it is crucial that all our tools possess the property of High Availability or, at least, Disaster Recovery.

The following architecture illustrates how Shuffle should be deployed in its On-Premise free mode to achieve at least Disaster Recovery, which ensures that even if one node of the system fails, there will be no loss of information. In the worst case scenario, if it was a critical node, it should be able to resume operation promptly.

The first step to ensure this is to distribute the database in a way that guarantees the property that even if one node fails, there will be no data loss.

The second point to consider is that for Workflows to continue running even if one Orborus node goes down, there should be another node of the same type to ensure this.

In this manner, we can ensure that, in the worst case, the backend+frontend may experience negative consequences due to being in a Docker container. However, its automatic restart can be configured, and in any case, bringing this node back into operation is swift.

The resulting architecture that emerges after applying these properties is as follows:

![DisasterRecovery On Premmise Deploy](https://github.com/Shuffle/Shuffle-docs/blob/master/assets/configuration-disaster-recovery-onprem-deploy.png?raw=true)

To implement this, follow these steps:

- Define in all your nodes the list of hostnames in /etc/hosts so all the machines can do the necessary IP resolutions when they have a hostname.

- Configure an OpenSearch database cluster. For this step, it is recommended to follow the official documentation [https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/tuning-your-cluster/index/](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/tuning-your-cluster/index/). Anyways to achieve this in a easy way you just need to change this settings in each opensearch node and reload the service:
```
cluster.name -> Set its new value to "shuffle-cluster".
node.name -> Set its new value to the hostname of the current node.
network.host -> Set its new value to the IP of your node(you need to be able to ping this IP from each one of the opensearch nodes and also from the backend+frontend one).
discovery.seed_hosts -> Set its new value to a list that contains each one of the hostnames of the OpenSearch nodes for example like this: ['opensearchReplica0', 'opensearchReplica1', 'opensearchReplica2']
cluster.initial_cluster_manager_nodes -> All the nodes should be able to be masters so as done before use that list of hostnames like: ['opensearchReplica0', 'opensearchReplica1', 'opensearchReplica2']
```

- Deploy a node containing both the frontend and backend components. In the configurations of this node, all nodes of the database cluster should be included to experience the effects of the previous step. The dockerfile should look like this:

```Dockerfile
version: '3'
services:
  frontend:
    image: ghcr.io/shuffle/shuffle-frontend:latest
    container_name: shuffle-frontend
    hostname: shuffle-frontend
    ports:
      - "${FRONTEND_PORT}:80"
      - "${FRONTEND_PORT_HTTPS}:443"
    networks:
      - shuffle
    environment:
      - BACKEND_HOSTNAME=${BACKEND_HOSTNAME}
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on:
      - backend
  backend:
    image: ghcr.io/shuffle/shuffle-backend:latest
    container_name: shuffle-backend
    hostname: ${BACKEND_HOSTNAME}
    # Here for debugging:
    ports:
      - "${BACKEND_PORT}:5001"
    networks:
      - shuffle
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - ${SHUFFLE_APP_HOTLOAD_LOCATION}:/shuffle-apps
      - ${SHUFFLE_FILE_LOCATION}:/shuffle-files
      #- ${SHUFFLE_OPENSEARCH_CERTIFICATE_FILE}:/shuffle-files/es_certificate
    env_file: .env
    environment:
      - SHUFFLE_APP_HOTLOAD_FOLDER=/shuffle-apps
      - SHUFFLE_FILE_LOCATION=/shuffle-files
    restart: unless-stopped
networks:
  shuffle:
    driver: bridge
```
Also for this step you need to change the value of a variable inside the .env so it looks like this:`SHUFFLE_OPENSEARCH_URL=SHUFFLE_OPENSEARCH_URL=https://192.168.0.30:9200,https://192.168.0.31:9200,https://192.168.0.32:9200`. Each one of that IPs is the corresponding one to each opensearch node.

- Deploy as many Orborus nodes as desired. At a minimum, it is recommended to deploy 2 nodes. If scaling is required regarding the maximum number of concurrently executing Workflows, the number of these nodes can be increased. The dockerfile of each one of the orborus nodes should look like this:

```Dockerfile
version: '3'
services:
  orborus:
    #build: ./functions/onprem/orborus
    image: ghcr.io/shuffle/shuffle-orborus:latest
    container_name: shuffle-orborus
    hostname: shuffle-orborus
    networks:
      - shuffle
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    environment:
      - BASE_URL=http://192.168.0.49:5001
      - SHUFFLE_APP_SDK_VERSION=1.1.0
      - SHUFFLE_WORKER_VERSION=latest
      - ENVIRONMENT_NAME=Shuffle
      - DOCKER_API_VERSION=1.40
      - SHUFFLE_BASE_IMAGE_NAME=frikky
      - SHUFFLE_BASE_IMAGE_REGISTRY=ghcr.io
      - SHUFFLE_BASE_IMAGE_TAG_SUFFIX="-1.0.0"
      - CLEANUP=true
      - SHUFFLE_ORBORUS_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT=600
    restart: unless-stopped
networks:
  shuffle:
    driver: bridge
```

You need to change the value of the environment `BASE_URL` of this Dockerfile, so it aims to the IP of your Shuffle frontend+backend node.

### Kubernetes

Shuffle use with Kubernetes is now possible due to help from our contributors. You can read more about how it works on our [Github page](https://github.com/Shuffle/Shuffle/tree/main/functions/kubernetes), which includes extensive helm charts and configuration possibilities.

Due to Kubernetes not being capable of building Shuffle Apps directly, an additional container for building them is available.

### Shuffle Apps on Kubernetes
By default, Shuffle Worker creates a Kubernetes Deployment and Service for each app. Each app and version has its own Deployment and Service. Shuffle automatically deploys a set of apps, and other apps are deployed on demand when they are first used.

You can use `app.*` Helm values to control parts of the app deployment (resources, security context, etc.). These values are converted to environment variables on Orborus, and Orborus passes them to Worker when creating app Deployments. When `worker.enableHelmDeployment` is set, the app configuration is set on the worker directly. This configuration applies to all apps (you cannot scale or resource-tune individual apps in this mode).

If you want to set CPU and memory for apps that are created dynamically by Worker, use `app.resources` (or `app.resourcesPreset`) in the chart. These values are applied to all dynamically created app Deployments.

If you want full control, you can deploy apps using Helm instead. This gives you:
- full control over app deployments via Helm values
- granular control per app and version (replicas, resources, etc.)
- fewer issues with on-demand started apps (see https://github.com/Shuffle/Shuffle/issues/1739)

To deploy apps using Helm, set `apps.enabled=true`. By default, this deploys `shuffle-tools`, `shuffle-subflow`, and `http`. You can add your own apps as well.

```yaml
app:
  replicaCount: 1
  resources: {}

apps:
  enabled: true

  shuffleTools:
    enabled: true
  shuffleSubflow:
    enabled: true
  http:
    enabled: true
    replicaCount: 1
    resources: {}

  opensearch:
    enabled: true
    name: opensearch
    version: 1.1.0
    replicaCount: 3
    resources: {}
```

Notes:
- The key under `apps` is only used to identify the app in values. It can be any unique name.
- You can override any `app.*` value for a specific app via `apps.<appKey>.*` (for example, `apps.shuffleTools.replicaCount`).
- Hybrid mode is supported: deploy some apps with Helm while still letting Worker create others on demand.

If you do not want Worker to manage app deployments, set `worker.manageAppDeployments=true`. This removes the required permissions from the Shuffle Worker Kubernetes Service Account and requires you to deploy all apps manually using Helm.

#### Shuffle App Service Accounts
By default, apps use a shared `shuffle-app` service account. If you deploy apps with Helm, you can use a dedicated service account per app.

```yaml
apps:
  myAppWithCustomServiceAccount:
    enabled: true
    name: my-custom-service-account
    version: 1.0.0
    serviceAccount:
      create: true
      name: shuffle-app-myapp

  anotherAppWithExistingServiceAccount:
    enabled: true
    name: another-app
    version: 1.0.0
    serviceAccount:
      create: false
      name: existing-service-account-name
```

All app service accounts use the `shuffle-app` role by default.

### Orborus with Kubernetes
To configure Kubernetes, you need to specify a single environment variable for Orborus: RUNNING_MODE. By setting the environment variable RUNNING_MODE=kubernetes, execution should work as expected!

### Scaling Kubernetes
To scale Shuffle in Kubernetes, use the following environment variables in the Orborus container:
```bash
SHUFFLE_SCALE_REPLICAS=3 # HPA coming soon. This is for static scaling.
SHUFFLE_WORKER_IMAGE=ghcr.io/shuffle/shuffle-worker-scale:nightly
IS_KUBERNETES=true
SHUFFLE_SWARM_CONFIG=run
SHUFFLE_MEMCACHED=shuffle-memcached:11211 # this depends on your setup.
```

### Private apps on Kubernetes
To run private apps on Kubernetes, you need a private container registry to pull images from. Once you configure `REGISTRY_URL` to point to your private registry, Shuffle will automatically pull app images from there.

To install the Shuffle Helm chart pointing to your custom registry, run:
```bash
helm install shuffle oci://ghcr.io/shuffle/charts/shuffle \
  --namespace shuffle \
  --create-namespace \
  --set env[0].name=REGISTRY_URL \
  --set env[0].value="YOURIP:5000"
```

If your registry allows unauthenticated pushes (or you're not using Docker Hub), you can skip this step.
However, if your private registry requires authentication, create and share a Docker registry secret using:
```bash
kubectl create secret docker-registry <your_secret_name> \
  --docker-server=<registry-url> \
  --docker-username=<user> \
  --docker-password=<pass> \
  --docker-email=<email> \
  -n shuffle

kubectl set env deployment/backend SHUFFLE_REGISTRY_SECRET="<your_secret_name>" -n shuffle
```

After switching to your private registry, the images for already-installed apps will not be available in the new registry. To avoid image-pull failures, you can mirror all existing Shuffle app images from Docker Hub into your private registry.

You can use `skopeo` to mirror the entire repository (docker.io/frikky/shuffle) or run the following script to pull and push every tag manually:
```bash
registry="your-registry.domain:5000"

page=1
while true; do
  tags=$(curl -s "https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/frikky/shuffle/tags?page=$page&page_size=100" | jq -r '.results[].name')
  [ -z "$tags" ] && break

  for tag in $tags; do
    echo "-> $tag"
    docker pull frikky/shuffle:$tag
    docker tag frikky/shuffle:$tag $registry/shuffle:$tag
    docker push $registry/shuffle:$tag
  done

  page=$((page+1))
done
```

### Swarm HAProxy for worker load balancing
In Docker Swarm, Orborus sends requests to `shuffle-workers:33333` through the Swarm VIP. The routing mesh is not load-aware, so requests can hit saturated workers and time out under load. You can improve distribution by placing HAProxy in front of the worker tasks and pointing Orborus to HAProxy.

This can be done after the Swarm stack is up, without changing how Orborus deploys workers or apps.

#### 1) Create the HAProxy config
Create a file named `haproxy.cfg` on a Swarm manager:
```cfg
global
  log stdout format raw local0
  maxconn 4000

defaults
  mode http
  log global
  option httplog
  option dontlognull
  timeout connect 5s
  timeout client  120s
  timeout server  120s

resolvers docker
  nameserver dns 127.0.0.11:53
  resolve_retries 3
  timeout retry 1s
  hold valid 10s

frontend worker_front
  bind *:33333
  default_backend worker_back

backend worker_back
  balance leastconn
  option tcp-check
  server-template worker 1-50 tasks.shuffle-workers:33333 check resolvers docker init-addr last,libc,none
```

#### 2) Deploy HAProxy as a Swarm service
Ensure the worker overlay network exists (Orborus creates `shuffle_swarm_executions` by default):
```bash
docker network create --driver=overlay --attachable shuffle_swarm_executions
```

Create the HAProxy config and deploy it. Do not publish port 33333 on HAProxy if the worker service already uses it (Swarm only allows one published service per port). Orborus can reach HAProxy over the overlay network:
```bash
docker config create haproxy-cfg ./haproxy.cfg

docker service create \
  --name shuffle-haproxy \
  --config source=haproxy-cfg,target=/usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg \
  --network shuffle_swarm_executions \
  haproxy:2.9
```

#### 3) Point Orborus to HAProxy
Set the worker server URL so Orborus sends executions through HAProxy:
```bash
SHUFFLE_WORKER_SERVER_URL=http://shuffle-haproxy:33333
```

Restart Orborus after updating the environment:
```bash
docker restart shuffle-orborus
```

#### 4) Verify
```bash
docker service logs shuffle-haproxy --tail 200
docker service ps shuffle-haproxy
```

### Swarm HA deployment (Gateway + API + Runtime)

This is a production-style Swarm setup that is reliable for first deployment and easy to scale later.

Traffic flow:

- Users hit `gateway` on `:8080`.
- `gateway` routes `/api/*` to `shuffle-backend` and `/` to `frontend`.
- `shuffle-backend` talks to OpenSearch and Memcached over internal overlay DNS.
- `orborus` runs execution scheduling and uses a dedicated execution overlay network.

#### Nginx-HA-behavior

In this setup, `gateway` is Nginx and acts as the edge router for both API and UI traffic.

- `/api/*` is proxied to backend tasks.
- `/` is proxied to frontend tasks.
- If one backend/frontend task fails, Nginx continues routing to remaining healthy tasks.

To make Nginx itself highly available:

- run `gateway` with 2+ replicas,
- spread replicas across nodes,
- use an external load balancer or DNS round-robin to route traffic to node IPs when using `ports.mode: host`.

Example scaling:

```bash
docker service scale shuffleha_gateway=2
docker service scale shuffleha_frontend=2
docker service scale shuffleha_shuffle-backend=2
```

When using host-published ports, avoid scheduling all `gateway` replicas on one node. Verify distribution with:

```bash
docker service ps shuffleha_gateway
```

#### Pre-flight (run once)

```bash
# 1) Initialize swarm if needed
docker swarm init || true

# 2) Create persistent folders
mkdir -p /srv/shuffle/shuffle-apps /srv/shuffle/shuffle-files /srv/shuffle/shuffle-database

# 3) Make sure this node can schedule services
docker node ls
```

```

#### Deploy

```bash
docker stack deploy -c docker-stack.ha.yml shuffleha
```

#### Verify (must pass)

```bash
docker service ls | grep shuffleha_
docker service ps shuffleha_gateway
docker service ps shuffleha_frontend
docker service ps shuffleha_shuffle-backend
docker service ps shuffleha_shuffle-opensearch
docker service ps shuffleha_shuffle-cache
docker service ps shuffleha_orborus
```

Quick API checks:

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:8080/
curl -i http://localhost:8080/api/v1/checkusers
```

If startup feels slow in the first 1-3 minutes, this is usually normal due to backend init tasks and OpenSearch warmup.

#### Single-node-vs-multi-node-replicas

- The example above is tuned to work on a single node on the first try.
- For multi-node HA, increase replicas after initial validation:

```bash
docker service scale shuffleha_frontend=2
docker service scale shuffleha_shuffle-backend=2
docker service scale shuffleha_orborus=2
```

If you use `max_replicas_per_node: 1`, make sure you have enough swarm nodes. Otherwise replicas stay pending.

`max_replicas_per_node: 1` can be useful for HA spreading when you run multiple nodes.

Recommended usage:

- Set it on services you want distributed, for example `shuffle-backend` and `orborus`.
- Keep replicas equal to or lower than the number of eligible nodes.
- For `orborus`, eligible nodes are manager nodes because of `node.role == manager` constraint.

Example:

```yaml
services:
  shuffle-backend:
    deploy:
      replicas: 3
      placement:
        max_replicas_per_node: 1

  orborus:
    deploy:
      replicas: 2
      placement:
        constraints:
          - node.role == manager
        max_replicas_per_node: 1
```

Practical checks:

```bash
docker node ls
docker service ps shuffleha_shuffle-backend
docker service ps shuffleha_orborus
```

If tasks stay `Pending`, lower replicas or add more eligible nodes.

#### Important Swarm DNS notes

- In some Swarm environments, service VIP routing can become unstable after many updates.
- If you see `no route to host` or random internal timeouts, prefer `tasks.<service-name>` for internal service-to-service traffic.
- `endpoint_mode: dnsrr` on OpenSearch and Memcached reduces reliance on VIP routing.

#### Swarm-overlay-network-encryption

If you want encrypted node-to-node traffic on Swarm overlays, pre-create encrypted networks and point your stack file to those external networks.

1) Pre-create encrypted overlays:

```bash
docker network create --driver overlay --attachable --opt encrypted shuffle
docker network create --driver overlay --attachable --opt encrypted swarm_executions
```

2) In your stack/compose config file, use external networks:

```yaml
networks:
  shuffle:
    external: true
    name: shuffle
  swarm_executions:
    external: true
    name: swarm_executions
```

3) Deploy as normal:

```bash
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml shuffle
```

4) Verify encryption and service attachment:

```bash
docker network inspect shuffle | grep -i encrypted
docker network inspect swarm_executions | grep -i encrypted
docker service inspect shuffle_backend --format '{{json .Spec.TaskTemplate.Networks}}'
docker service inspect shuffle_orborus --format '{{json .Spec.TaskTemplate.Networks}}'
```

Notes:

- Overlay encryption secures node-to-node container traffic on those overlays.
- It does not replace HTTPS/TLS for user-facing traffic.
- Orborus can create missing Swarm networks dynamically; pre-creating encrypted overlays avoids accidental unencrypted network creation.

#### Slow backend response troubleshooting

If backend APIs are slow after deployment, check these first:

1. Backend startup/init window:
   - Backend may perform index checks, rollovers, and startup validation.
   - During this phase, response times can be temporarily high.

2. Memcached connectivity:
   - Repeated memcache timeouts add latency to many API calls.
   - Validate from backend container:

```bash
docker exec -it <backend-container> sh -lc 'getent hosts shuffle-cache tasks.shuffle-cache'
docker exec -it <backend-container> sh -lc 'nc -vz -w2 tasks.shuffle-cache 11211'
```

3. OpenSearch connectivity:

```bash
docker exec -it <backend-container> sh -lc 'nc -vz -w2 tasks.shuffle-opensearch 9200'
```

4. Live logs:

```bash
docker service logs --since 10m shuffleha_shuffle-backend
docker service logs --since 10m shuffleha_shuffle-cache
docker service logs --since 10m shuffleha_shuffle-opensearch
```

Temporary mitigation if memcached routing is unstable:

- Remove `SHUFFLE_MEMCACHED` from backend/orborus and redeploy.
- This usually improves API responsiveness immediately while you fix cache routing.

#### Production recommendations

- Use at least 3 Swarm manager/worker nodes for HA.
- Run OpenSearch as a proper multi-node cluster for production data durability.
- Mount persistent volumes for:
  - OpenSearch data (`shuffle-database`),
  - Shuffle files (`shuffle-files`),
  - app hotload directory (`shuffle-apps`).
- Keep gateway, backend, and frontend on the same overlay network.
- Keep execution workloads isolated on `swarm_executions`.
- Monitor `docker service ps` and `docker service logs` continuously during upgrades.

#### Preferred-OpenSearch-HA-setup

The `shuffle-opensearch` service in the Swarm HA example above is intentionally single-node. It is suitable for first deployment validation, but it is **not** the preferred production architecture for durable data.

For production, the recommended setup is:

- 3 dedicated OpenSearch nodes
- one persistent data path per OpenSearch node
- replication handled by OpenSearch itself, not by sharing one filesystem
- Shuffle backend configured with all OpenSearch endpoints

The most important storage rule is:

- do **not** mount the same shared `shuffle-database` folder into multiple OpenSearch nodes
- do **not** use one NFS path as `/usr/share/opensearch/data` for several OpenSearch nodes
- do give each node its own local persistent disk or block volume

This means the storage model is different for different Shuffle components:

- `shuffle-files`: shared storage is fine, and NFS is a common option
- `shuffle-apps`: shared storage is fine if you want hotload content available across nodes
- `shuffle-database`: should be local and dedicated per OpenSearch node

Example topology:

- `opensearch-1` on node A with `/srv/opensearch-data`
- `opensearch-2` on node B with `/srv/opensearch-data`
- `opensearch-3` on node C with `/srv/opensearch-data`

Each OpenSearch node should have equivalent settings to the following:

```yaml
environment:
  - cluster.name=shuffle-cluster
  - node.name=opensearch-1
  - network.host=_site_
  - discovery.seed_hosts=opensearch-1,opensearch-2,opensearch-3
  - cluster.initial_cluster_manager_nodes=opensearch-1,opensearch-2,opensearch-3
  - bootstrap.memory_lock=true
  - node.store.allow_mmap=false
  - OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms4g -Xmx4g
```

Notes:

- `node.name` must be unique on each node
- `discovery.seed_hosts` and `cluster.initial_cluster_manager_nodes` should contain all 3 OpenSearch nodes
- `network.host` must be reachable from the other OpenSearch nodes and from Shuffle backend
- size the Java heap according to available memory; a common starting point is 50% of RAM, with equal `-Xms` and `-Xmx`

Once the OpenSearch cluster is healthy, configure Shuffle backend to talk to all nodes:

```bash
SHUFFLE_OPENSEARCH_URL=https://10.0.0.30:9200,https://10.0.0.31:9200,https://10.0.0.32:9200
```

If you use TLS or authentication on OpenSearch, keep the matching backend settings in place as well, such as:

```bash
SHUFFLE_OPENSEARCH_SKIPSSL_VERIFY=false
SHUFFLE_OPENSEARCH_CERTIFICATE_FILE=/shuffle-files/es_certificate
```

#### OpenSearch TLS certificate setup

`SHUFFLE_OPENSEARCH_CERTIFICATE_FILE` should point to a CA certificate file inside the backend container/pod. Shuffle reads this file and uses it as the CA trust when connecting to OpenSearch.

##### Quick start

1. Place your OpenSearch CA certificate on the host (PEM format), for example `./certs/es-ca.pem`.
2. Mount it into backend at a stable path (for example `/shuffle-files/es_certificate`).
3. Set backend environment variables:

```bash
SHUFFLE_OPENSEARCH_URL=https://<opensearch-host>:9200
SHUFFLE_OPENSEARCH_USERNAME=<username>
SHUFFLE_OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD=<password>
SHUFFLE_OPENSEARCH_CERTIFICATE_FILE=/shuffle-files/es_certificate
SHUFFLE_OPENSEARCH_SKIPSSL_VERIFY=false
```

4. Restart/redeploy backend.
5. Verify:

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:8080/api/v1/checkusers
```

Expected backend log line:

```text
[INFO] Added certificate /shuffle-files/es_certificate elastic client.
```

Compose example (backend service):

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./certs/es-ca.pem:/shuffle-files/es_certificate:ro
environment:
  - SHUFFLE_OPENSEARCH_URL=https://shuffle-opensearch:9200
  - SHUFFLE_OPENSEARCH_CERTIFICATE_FILE=/shuffle-files/es_certificate
  - SHUFFLE_OPENSEARCH_SKIPSSL_VERIFY=false
```

Kubernetes/Helm example:

```yaml
backend:
  openSearch:
    url: https://opensearch.example.svc:9200
    certificateFile: /certs/es-ca.pem
    skipSSLVerify: false
    username: admin
  extraVolumes:
    - name: opensearch-ca
      secret:
        secretName: opensearch-ca
  extraVolumeMounts:
    - name: opensearch-ca
      mountPath: /certs
      readOnly: true
```

##### Production hardening checklist

- Keep `SHUFFLE_OPENSEARCH_SKIPSSL_VERIFY=false` in production.
- Make sure every hostname in `SHUFFLE_OPENSEARCH_URL` exists in certificate SANs.
- Use `https://` endpoints only when OpenSearch security/TLS is enabled.
- Store OpenSearch credentials as secrets (not plaintext in committed files).
- Rotate certs and credentials regularly; test rollover in staging first.
- Validate failover with one OpenSearch node down while Shuffle remains operational.

Common failure patterns:

- `x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`: wrong/missing CA file mount or path.
- `certificate is valid for X, not Y`: endpoint hostname does not match cert SAN.
- `401/403`: bad username/password or role permissions.
- HTTP/HTTPS mismatch errors: `SHUFFLE_OPENSEARCH_URL` protocol does not match OpenSearch security mode.

If you prefer to keep OpenSearch inside Swarm, treat each node as a fixed service instead of one floating replicated service:

- deploy one OpenSearch service per host
- add placement constraints so each service stays on its intended node
- mount that host's local disk path into that service
- configure all OpenSearch nodes to join the same cluster

This avoids the common failure mode where one OpenSearch container is rescheduled onto another node that does not have the original data path.

#### OpenSearch HA validation checklist

Before pointing production Shuffle traffic at the new cluster, validate in this order:

1. Confirm cluster formation from OpenSearch:

```bash
curl -k -u admin:'<password>' https://10.0.0.30:9200/_cluster/health?pretty
curl -k -u admin:'<password>' https://10.0.0.30:9200/_cat/nodes?v
curl -k -u admin:'<password>' https://10.0.0.30:9200/_cat/shards?v
```

2. Update `SHUFFLE_OPENSEARCH_URL` on backend and redeploy Shuffle backend.

3. Validate Shuffle itself:

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:8080/api/v1/checkusers
```

Then log in, save a workflow, execute a workflow, and confirm execution history is written successfully.

4. Run a failover test:

- stop one OpenSearch node
- confirm Shuffle remains usable
- confirm cluster health degrades but stays operational
- start the node again and verify it rejoins

5. Run a persistence test:

- restart OpenSearch nodes one at a time
- confirm indices and execution history remain intact

For additional OpenSearch sizing, shard allocation, and cluster tuning guidance, follow the official OpenSearch documentation:

- https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/tuning-your-cluster/

## Networking
Networking with Shuffle is pretty straight forward. What we check for are the following:

- Can Shuffle reach your services?
- Can the Shuffle services reach each other (frontend/backend/database/Orborus)

There are however many things that can go wrong with these simple mechanisms, leading to a need for network configuration changes. Shuffle is however built on HTTP, and can be easily modified and made to work both in air-gapped locations as well as with enterprise proxy environments.

### Proxy configuration

Proxies are another requirement to many enterprises, hence it's an important feature to support. There are two places where proxies can be implemented:

* Shuffle Backend: Connects to Github and Dockerhub.
* Shuffle Orborus: Connects to Dockerhub and Shuffle Backend.

**PS: Orborus settings are also set for the Worker**

To configure these, there are two options:

* Internal vs External proxy (shuffle vs apps)
* Individual containers
* Globally for Docker

To **DISABLE** proxy for **internal** Shuffle traffic (between internal containers), add the following environment variables to Orborus:
```
SHUFFLE_INTERNAL_HTTP_PROXY=noproxy
SHUFFLE_INTERNAL_HTTPS_PROXY=noproxy
```

To disable proxy use for specific domains, use NO_PROXY with comma separation between domains:
```
NO_PROXY=myinternal-domain.com,random.org
```

If you need a separate no-proxy list for internal Shuffle traffic, set one of these on Orborus:
```
SHUFFLE_INTERNAL_NO_PROXY=shuffle-backend,shuffle-workers
# Legacy alias also supported by backend/shared code:
SHUFFLE_INTERNAL_NOPROXY=shuffle-backend,shuffle-workers
```

#### Global Docker proxy configuration

Follow this guide from Docker: https://docs.docker.com/network/proxy/

### Internal Proxy settings

The main proxy issues may arise with the Backend and Orborus containers. This is related to how Orborus reaches the backend, how the worker downloads apps, and how apps connect to external systems.

Current behavior in code:

- `SHUFFLE_PASS_WORKER_PROXY=true`: Orborus passes `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` to Worker containers.
- `SHUFFLE_PASS_APP_PROXY=true`: Worker passes `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`, and `no_proxy` to App containers.
- If set, `SHUFFLE_INTERNAL_HTTP_PROXY` and `SHUFFLE_INTERNAL_HTTPS_PROXY` are also forwarded down to Worker and App containers.
- Backend internal HTTP clients switch to `SHUFFLE_INTERNAL_*` when talking to internal Shuffle targets (`shuffle-*` hosts, worker/app ports, and the `BASE_URL` host match).
- Setting `SHUFFLE_INTERNAL_HTTP_PROXY=noproxy` and `SHUFFLE_INTERNAL_HTTPS_PROXY=noproxy` disables internal proxying for those internal routes.

Environment variables to be sent to the Orborus container:

```
# Configures a HTTP proxy to use when talking to the Shuffle Backend
HTTP_PROXY=
# Configures a HTTPS proxy when speaking to the Shuffle Backend
HTTPS_PROXY=

# Set to true to pass HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY/NO_PROXY from Orborus to Worker
SHUFFLE_PASS_WORKER_PROXY=true

# Set to true to pass HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY/NO_PROXY from Worker to Apps
SHUFFLE_PASS_APP_PROXY=false

# Optional: separate no-proxy list for internal Shuffle routes
SHUFFLE_INTERNAL_NO_PROXY=
```

Environment variables for the Backend container:

```
# A proxy to be used if Opensearch / Elasticsearch (database) is behind a proxy.
SHUFFLE_OPENSEARCH_PROXY

# Configures a HTTP proxy for external downloads
HTTP_PROXY=
# Configures a HTTPS proxy for external downloads
HTTPS_PROXY=
```

### Opensearch / Elasticsearch proxies
Connections from Shuffle's backend to the Opensearch database **does NOT** follow normal HTTP_PROXY and NOPROXY environment variables.

Opensearch and Elasticsearch proxy configuration can be set using the `SHUFFLE_OPENSEARCH_PROXY` environment variable.

#### Individual container proxy

To set up proxies in individual containers, open docker-compose.yml and add the following lines with your proxy settings (http://my-proxy.com:8080 in my case).

**PS: Make sure to use uppercase letters, and not lowercase (HTTP_PROXY, NOT http_proxy)**

![Proxy containers](https://github.com/shuffle/shuffle-docs/blob/master/assets/proxy-containers.png?raw=true)

### Orborus running on a different network
All you'll need to do is allow orborus to have access to the backend OR frontend of Shuffle.

### Internal vs External proxy
As of November 2023, we added another way to configure a difference between these two:
- Internal tools like Backend -> Orborus -> Worker <-> Apps
- Apps -> External tools

This makes it possible to have an internal proxy that is different from what apps use for external services. These environment variables should be added to the Orborus container.

```
HTTP_PROXY=<external proxy>                     # used by default for everything
HTTPS_PROXY=<external https proxy>

SHUFFLE_INTERNAL_HTTP_PROXY=<internal proxy>     # Overrides HTTP_PROXY, making internal services in Shuffle use this proxy instead of HTTP_PROXY.
SHUFFLE_INTERNAL_HTTPS_PROXY=<internal https proxy>
SHUFFLE_INTERNAL_NO_PROXY=shuffle-backend,shuffle-workers
```

**PS: This is in beta. Reach out to support@shuffler.io if you have any trouble with this.**

### App SDK proxy behavior

`shuffle_sdk` initializes proxy settings in this order:

1. `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`
2. Override with `SHUFFLE_INTERNAL_HTTP_PROXY`, `SHUFFLE_INTERNAL_HTTPS_PROXY`, and `SHUFFLE_INTERNAL_NO_PROXY` when set
3. If proxy value is `noproxy`, it is treated as disabled

The SDK applies this proxy config to its own HTTP calls (for example: results streaming, datastore/cache APIs, and file APIs).

Current implementation note: when `SHUFFLE_INTERNAL_HTTPS_PROXY` is set, the SDK currently applies the value from `SHUFFLE_INTERNAL_HTTP_PROXY` for HTTPS traffic as well. Set both internal proxy vars to the same value if you need consistent behavior.

### HTTPS

HTTPS is enabled by default on port 3443 with a self-signed certificate for localhost. If you would like to change this, the only way (currently) is to add configure and rebuild the frontend. If you don't have HTTPS enabled, check [updating shuffle](#updating_shuffle) to get the latest configuration. Another workaround is to set up an [Nginx reverse proxy](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/) you can control yourself. See further down for more details

```
After setting this up, make sure to change the BASE_URL for Orborus to talk to your new HTTPS url if you want encrypted traffic everywhere.
Default Routing: Orborus -> Backend:5001.
New Routing: Orborus -> Nginx -> Frontend -> Backend.

The New Routing steps are automatic as long as you update the BASE_URL to point to your new reverse proxy URL.
```

Necessary info for the truststore to create TLS/SSL certificates:

* Certificates are located in ./frontend/certs.
* ./frontend/README.md contains information on generating a self-signed cert
* (default): Privatekey is named privkey.pem
* (default): Fullchain is named fullchain.pem

If you want to change this, edit ./frontend/Dockerfile and ./frontend/nginx.conf.

After changing certificates, you can rebuild the entire frontend by running (./frontend)

```
./run.sh --latest
```

Make sure that the output image is the same in your docker-compose.yml file. This should work seemlessly for you next.

### App Certificates
As of November 2023, it is possible to mount folders into apps. This is in order for you to have better control of what Shuffle Apps can do, with the main reason being to manage certificates or dynamic, large files.

To mount in certificates to ALL App containers, add the following environment variable to the "Orborus" container, but change the source and destination folder. The item BEFORE the colon (:) is the source folder on your machine, with the one AFTER the colon (:) being for the destination folder in the app itself.

If you want more multiple folders mounted, add them with a comma. Folders MUST exist, otherwise apps may not run, and the Worker will throw an error in the logs with Workflow Runs not finishing. If you are in production, we recommend trying this feature in a separate Runtime Location.
```
SHUFFLE_VOLUME_BINDS="/etc/ssl/certs:/usr/local/share/ca-certificates,/srcfolder:/dstfolder"
```

### Using the Nginx Reverse Proxy for TLS/SSL
If you intend to use Nginx as a Reverse Proxy, the main steps are below. [Here is a basic single-server architecture for it](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1zJU8yMzbsu-XWeZnch_5MoDwmMNkkN8ZmoGNLCaHPlU/edit?usp=sharing). The Docker version is further down.

1. [Install Nginx](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-20-04) on your server (find the correct distro), or in a [Docker container by itself](https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/Docker-Nginx-reverse-proxy-setup-example).
2. Make sure you have a VALID certificate that matches your domain/hostname and [add this to your Nginx server](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-ssl-certificate-nginx)
3. In the nginx.conf file (/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf or similar), under "server", add the information below. Make sure to change the "proxy_pass" part. This is how it will redirect all /api requests.
```
location / {
    proxy_pass SHUFFLE FRONTENDIP;
    proxy_buffering off;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;

    proxy_connect_timeout 900;
    proxy_send_timeout 900;
    proxy_read_timeout 900;
    send_timeout 900;
    proxy_ssl_verify off;
}
```
4. Restart Nginx! `systemctl restart nginx`

### Nginx in Docker
1. Add the following service to your docker-compose.yml
```
  nginx-proxy:
    image: nginx:latest
    container_name: shuffle-nginx-proxy
    networks:
      - shuffle
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx-conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d
      - ./certs:/etc/nginx/certs
    restart: always
```

2. Add a new nginx configuration file called `nginx-conf` with the following (you may add additional Nginx configuration to this):
```
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/certs/cert.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/certs/cert.key;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://shuffle-frontend:80;

        proxy_buffering off;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;

        proxy_connect_timeout 900;
        proxy_send_timeout 900;
        proxy_read_timeout 900;
        send_timeout 900;
        proxy_ssl_verify off;
    }
}
```

3. Add a folder called "certs" with **your certificates** named `cert.crt` and `cert.key`.
4. Restart everything: `docker-compose down; docker-compose up -d`

### Internal Certificate Authority
By default, certificates are not being verified when outbound traffic goes from Shuffle. This is due to the massive use of self-signed certificates when using internal services. You may ignore certificate warnings by adding `SHUFFLE_SKIPSSL_VERIFY=true` to the environment of each relevant service - most notably used for Orborus.  If you want to accept your Certificate Authority for all requests, there are a few ways to do this:

1. Mount your CA certificates (recommended): Add the `./certs:/certs` mount to the Orborus service in your docker-compose.yml. Ensure that the shuffle directory contains a certs subdirectory with all the necessary certificate files. This will automatically append all certificates in `./certs` to the system's root CA.
2. Docker Daemon level  - point to your cert: `$ dockerd --tlscacert=/path/to/custom-ca-cert.pem`
3. Add it to every app (per-image configuration). You can do this by modifying the Dockerfile for an app and manually building it with the certificate in the Dockerfile of each Docker image. Restart Shuffle after this is done.

As this may require advanced Docker understanding, reach out to ask us about it: [support@shuffler.io](mailto:support@shuffler.io)

### IPv6

Shuffle supports IPv6 in Docker by default, but your docker engine may not. IPv6 can be enabled in Docker by adding it to the /etc/docker/daemon.json file on the host as per this article by Docker:

[https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/ipv6/](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/ipv6/)


### Enterprise Environments

In most enterprise environments, Shuffle will be behind firewalls, proxies and other networking equipment. If this is the case, below are the requirements to make Shuffle work anywhere. The most common issue has to do with downloads from Alpine linux's Docker images while Shuffle is running.

**PS:** If external connections are blocked, you may further have issues running Apps. Read more about [manual image transfers here](#manual_docker_image_transfers).

### Change the Database from OpenSearch to Elasticsearch

-	Open the Docker-compose.yml file in the Shuffle directory. Find the OpenSearch container section and either comment out or remove the details. Save your modifications to the file.

 	![image](https://github.com/yogeshgurjar127/Shuffle-docs/assets/118437260/5a9ff541-14f4-4ddc-8c04-08a874ffc3ff)

- Now open the .env file and change the below value in the .env  from false to true for Elasticsearch database enable.

  ![image](https://github.com/yogeshgurjar127/Shuffle-docs/assets/118437260/f1116c97-daa2-48ba-80f4-f14803c1629d)

-	Find the part in the .env file that defines database configurations. Update the Elasticsearch host configuration using your Elasticsearch IP address.

  ![image](https://github.com/yogeshgurjar127/Shuffle-docs/assets/118437260/13277ad5-269d-44a7-ab3b-13916bb9ce0e)




### Domain Whitelisting

These URL's are used to get Shuffle up and running. Whitelisting them for the Shuffle services should make all processes work seamlessly.

PS: We do intend to make this JUST https://shuffler.io in the future.

```
# Can be closed after install with working Workflows
shuffler.io                                                      # Initial setup & future app/workflow sync
github.com                                                        # Downloading apps, workflows and documentation
pkg-containers.githubusercontent.com     # Downloads from Github Container registry (ghcr.io)
raw.githubusercontent.com                         # Downloads our Documentation raw from github (https://github.com/shuffle/shuffle-docs)

# Should stay open
dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org                        # Used for building apps in realtime
registry.hub.docker.com                     # Downloads apps if they don't exist locally
ghcr.io                                                        # Github Docker registry
auth.docker.io                                        # Dockerhub authentication
registry-1.docker.io                            # Dockerhub registry (for apps)
production.cloudflare.docker.com     # Protects of DockerHub
```

### Incoming IP Whitelisting

When using Shuffle in the cloud (*.shuffler.io), the incoming IP to your services by default will be be from our cloud functions, if you are not using [Runtime Locations](/admin?tab=locations). The range is **not static**, and may wary based on region. Here's a list (mostly IPv6 as of 2025):

```
Default (London): 2600:1900:2000:2a:400::0 -> 2600:1900:2000:2a:400::ffff
```

If you want direct access with ANY app in your on-premises environment, we recommend setting up a new environment on a server in the same network. Steps to set this up:

1. Go to [/admin?tab=locations](/admin?tab=locations) and create a new runtime location
2. Click the Copy button in the "Command" tab to copy the relevant Docker command. This requires Docker installed on the server in question.
3. Run the copied command on your server on-premises.
4. Change the Environment a workflow runs with to the new environment. When ran, it will automatically run on YOUR server, instead of on our cloud.
5. Your server will now be reaching out to Shuffle cloud for jobs every few seconds. This requires outbound access from YOUR network to the domains shuffler.io and shuffle-backend-stbuwivzoq-nw.a.run.app.

### Static inbound IPs for cloud
As a customer of Shuffle we can provide you with a static **IP range** with secondary domains that can be used for cloud routing. May incur costs depending on needs. Contact support@shuffler.io for more info. 

Areas of relevance:
- Your Environment -> Shuffle Cloud (*.shuffler.io)
- Shuffle Cloud -> Your Enviroment

### Manual Docker image transfers

In certain cases you may not have access to download or build images at all. If that's the case, you'll need to manually transfer them to the appropriate server. If the image to transfer is an app, it should be moved to the "Orborus" server. Otherwise; backend server.

```
# 1. Download the image you want. Go to [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com/r/frikky/shuffle/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated) and find the image. Download with docker pull. E.g. for Shuffle-tools:
docker pull frikky/shuffle:shuffle-tools_1.1.0

# 2. Save the image to a file to be transferred.
docker save frikky/shuffle:shuffle-tools_1.1.0 > shuffle_tools.tar

# 3. Transfer the file to a remote server
scp shuffle_tools.tar username@<server>:/path/to/destination/shuffle_tools.tar

# 4. Log into the remote server and find the repository
ssh username@<server>
cd /path/to/destination #same path as above

# 5. Load the file!
docker load shuffle_tools.tar

## All done!

# Transfer between 2 remote hosts:
#scp -3 centos@10.0.0.1:/home/user/wazuh.tar centos@10.0.0.2:/home/user/wazuh.tar
```

### No Internet Install
This procedure will help you export what you need to run Shuffle on a no internet host.

**The following features will not work without internet:**
- Cloud Sync
- Automatic Health System (/health page)
- UI app activations
- Automatic App generation AI
- Depending on your network: Search engine. This is a frontend feature, if you are in a no-internet zone, it will stop working.

1. Prerequise
* Both machines has Docker and Docker Compose installed already

* Your host machine already needs the images on it to make them exportable
2. Pull images on original machine

Shuffle need a few base images to work:

- shuffle-frontend
- shuffle-backend
- shuffle-orborus
- shuffle-worker
- shuffle:app_sdk
- opensearch
- shuffle-subflow

```
 docker pull ghcr.io/frikky/shuffle-backend & docker pull ghcr.io/frikky/shuffle-frontend & docker pull ghcr.io/frikky/shuffle-orborus &  docker pull frikky/shuffle:app_sdk & docker pull ghcr.io/frikky/shuffle-worker & docker pull opensearchproject/opensearch:2.5.0 & docker pull registry.hub.docker.com/frikky/shuffle:shuffle-subflow_1.0.0
```

Be careful with the versioning for opensearch, all other are going to use the tag "latest".
You will also need to download and transfer ALL the apps you want to use. These can be discovered as such:

```
docker images | grep -i shuffle
```

3. Save images and archive them

```
mkdir shuffle-export & cd shuffle-export

docker save ghcr.io/frikky/shuffle-backend > backend.tar
docker save ghcr.io/frikky/shuffle-frontend > frontend.tar
docker save ghcr.io/frikky/shuffle-orborus > orborus.tar
docker save frikky/shuffle:app_sdk > app_sdk.tar
docker save ghcr.io/frikky/shuffle-worker:latest > worker.tar
docker save opensearchproject/opensearch:2.5.0 > opensearch.tar
docker save registry.hub.docker.com/frikky/shuffle:shuffle-subflow_1.0.0 > sublow.tar

git pull https://github.com/Shuffle/python-apps.git

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shuffle/Shuffle/master/.env
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shuffle/Shuffle/master/docker-compose.yml

cd .. & tar cvf shuffle-export.tar.gz shuffle-export
```

4. Export data to the targeted machine

Use scp, usb key, ..., to copy the previous archive to the machine. [More about manual transfers here](/docs/configuration#manual_docker_image_transfers)

5. Import docker images to host without internet

   ```
   tar xvf shuffle-export.tar.gz & cd shuffle-export
   find -type f -name "*.tar" -exec docker load --input "{}" \;
   ```

6. Deploy Shuffle without Internet

Create folders to add the python apps

```
mkdir shuffle-apps
cp -a python-apps/ * shuffle-apps/
```

Now, you just need to configure and install Shuffler like in normal procedure

### Database

To modify the database location, change "DB_LOCATION" in .env (root dir) to your new location.

### Database indexes (OpenSearch)

Shuffle uses OpenSearch (or Elasticsearch) as its primary database. Below is a complete list of all indexes used by Shuffle, organized by category.

#### Default Credentials
The default OpenSearch credentials for Shuffle are:
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `StrongShufflePassword321!`

These can be changed via environment variables in your `.env` file:
- `SHUFFLE_OPENSEARCH_USERNAME`
- `SHUFFLE_OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD`

#### Index Prefix
You can set a custom prefix for all indexes using the `SHUFFLE_OPENSEARCH_INDEX_PREFIX` environment variable. This is useful when running multiple Shuffle instances on a single OpenSearch cluster.

Example: If `SHUFFLE_OPENSEARCH_INDEX_PREFIX=prod`, the `workflow` index becomes `prod_workflow`.

#### Indexes with Aliasing & Rollover

The following 11 indexes are configured with **aliasing and automatic rollover** for better scaling. These indexes are created with the pattern `{index}-000001` and have an alias pointing to the write index. This is handled by `InitOpensearchIndexes()` on startup.

```
workflowexecution, datastore_ngram, org_cache, org_cache_revisions,
notifications, shuffle_logs, environments, org_statistics,
workflowapp, workflow, workflow_revisions
```

**Default rollover conditions:**
- Max age: 90 days
- Max size: 40GB
- Max documents: 1,000,000

**Default index settings:**
- Shards: 3
- Replicas: 1
- Refresh interval: 30s

You can customize these with environment variables:
- `OPENSEARCH_INDEX_CONFIG` - Custom JSON for index settings/mappings
- `OPENSEARCH_INDEX_ROLLOVER` - Custom JSON for rollover conditions
- `SHUFFLE_SKIP_OPENSEARCH_INDEX_INIT=true` - Skip automatic index initialization

### Re-indexing & Index Management

#### When to Re-index
Re-indexing is rarely needed since Shuffle uses automatic rollover for high-volume indexes. However, you may need to re-index when:

- **`workflowexecution` is slow** - The most common issue. If this index grew large before rollover was configured, queries become slow. Re-index into a fresh index with proper aliasing.
- **Changing shard count** - OpenSearch locks primary shard count at creation. If you need more shards for a large dataset, you must re-index.
- **Field mapping changes** - OpenSearch doesn't allow changing field types (e.g., `text` to `keyword`). Schema changes require re-indexing.
- **Index corruption** - Rare, but if an index gets corrupted, re-index from backups.
- **Cluster migration** - Moving from single-node to clustered OpenSearch, or migrating between clusters.

#### Re-indexing a Single Index
```bash
# Using OpenSearch API directly
curl -X POST "https://localhost:9200/_reindex" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "source": { "index": "workflow" },
  "dest": { "index": "workflow_new" }
}'

# Then swap the alias or update Shuffle to use the new index
```

#### Checking Index Health
```bash
# List all Shuffle indexes
curl -X GET "https://localhost:9200/_cat/indices/*workflow*?v"

# Check index aliases
curl -X GET "https://localhost:9200/_cat/aliases?v"

# Check rollover status for aliased indexes
curl -X GET "https://localhost:9200/workflowexecution/_alias"
```

#### Manual Rollover
If an index grows too large before automatic rollover triggers:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://localhost:9200/workflowexecution/_rollover" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "conditions": {
    "max_docs": 500000
  }
}'
```

#### Deleting Old Index Data
For indexes with rollover, you can delete old backing indexes:
```bash
# List backing indexes
curl -X GET "https://localhost:9200/_cat/indices/workflowexecution-*?v"

# Delete a specific old backing index (be careful!)
curl -X DELETE "https://localhost:9200/workflowexecution-000001"
```

**Warning:** Always backup data before re-indexing or deleting indexes. Use OpenSearch snapshots for production environments.

## Debugging

As Shuffle has a lot of individual parts, debugging can be quite tricky. To get started, here's a list of the different parts, with the latter three being modular / location independent.

| Type                                        | Container name        | Technology       | Note                                                                                                       |

### Disabling Image downloads
There are cases where automatic image downloads may occur, such as when you restart Orborus. You can disable this with `SHUFFLE_AUTO_IMAGE_DOWNLOAD=false`


### Execution debugging

Execution debugging might be the most notable issue you might explain. This is because there are a ton of reasons that it might crash. Before going into techniques to find what's going on, you'll need to understand what exactly happens when you click the big execution button.

**Frontend click -> Backend verifies and deploys executions -> (based on environments) orborus deploys a new worker -> worker finds actions to execute -> your app is executed.**

1. A workflow is executed
2. The backend verifies whether you can execute and deploys to environment
3. Orborus is listening to environment and deploys worker if it's the correct one
4. Worker deploys actions if they have the right environment
5. App executes and returns data back to the execution

As previously stated, a lot can go wrong. Here's the most common issues:

* Networking (firewalls / proxies)
* Badly formed apps.
* Bad environment

### General debugging

This part is mean to describe how to go about finding the issue you're having with executions. In most cases, you should start from the top of the list previously described in the following way:

1. Find out what environment your action(s) are running under by clicking the App and seeing "Environment" dropdown. In this case (and default) is "Shuffle". Environments can be specified / changed under the path /admin
   ![Check execution 3](https://github.com/shuffle/shuffle-docs/blob/master/assets/check_execution_3.png?raw=true)

2. Check if the workflow executed at all by finding the execution line in the shuffle-backend container. Take note that it mentions environment "Shuffle", as found in the previous step.

   ```
   docker logs -f shuffle-backend
   ```

![Check execution 1](https://github.com/shuffle/shuffle-docs/blob/master/assets/check_execution_1.png?raw=true)

3. If it executed, check whether Orborus is running, before checking it's logs for "Container \<container_id\> is created. The container_id is the worker it has deployed. Take not of the environment again at the end of the line. If you don't see this line, it's most likely because it's running in the wrong environment.

Check if shuffle-orborus is running

```
docker ps # Check if shuffle-orborus is running
```

Find whether it was deployed or not

```
docker logs -f shuffle-orborus  # Get logs from shuffle-orborus
```

![Check execution 2](https://github.com/shuffle/shuffle-docs/blob/master/assets/check_execution_2.png?raw=true)

Check environment of running shuffle-orborus container.

```
docker inspect shuffle-orborus | grep -i "ENV"
```

Expected env result where "Shuffle" corresponds to the environment
![Check execution 4](https://github.com/shuffle/shuffle-docs/blob/master/assets/check_execution_4.png?raw=true)

4. Check whether the worker executed your app. Remember that we found \<container_id\> previously by checking the logs of shuffle-orborus? Now we need that one. Workers are and will always be verbose, specifically for the reason of potential debugging.

Find logs from a docker container

```
docker logs -f CONTAINER_ID
```

![Check execution 5](https://github.com/shuffle/shuffle-docs/blob/master/assets/check_execution_5.png?raw=true)

As can be seen in the image above, is shows the exact execution order it takes. It starts by finding the parents, before executing the child process after it's finished. Take note of the specific apps being executed as well. It says "Time to execute \<app_id\> with app \<app_name:app_version\>. This indicates the app THAT WILL be executed. The following lines saying "Container \<container_id\> is the container created with this app.



5. App debugging in itself might be the trickiest. There are a lot of factors like branches, bad workflow building etc that might come into play. This builds on the same concept as the worker, where you pass the container ID it specified.

Get the app logs

```
docker logs -f CONTAINER_ID # The CONTAINER_ID found in the previous worker logs
```

As you will notice, app logs can be quite verbose (optional in a later build). In essence, if you see "RUNNING NORMAL EXECUTION" in the end, there's a 99.9% chance that it worked, otherwise some issue might have occurred.

Please [notify me](https://twitter.com/frikkylikeme) if you need help debugging app executions ASAP, as I've done a lot of it, but it's more tricky than the other steps.

### Hybrid docker image handling

We currently don't have a Docker Registry for Shuffle, meaning you need some minor configuration to get Orborus running remotely with the right containers. This only applies to containers not on dockerhub, as we automatically push PYTHON containers there when updated (not OpenAPI)

Here's an example of how to handle this with two different servers and Docker

```
ssh user@10.0.0.1
docker save frikky/shuffle:wazuh_api_rest_1.0.0 > wazuh.tar
exit
scp -3 centos@10.0.0.1:/home/user/wazuh.tar centos@10.0.0.2:/home/user/wazuh.tar
ssh user@10.0.0.2
docker load wazuh.tar
```

## Docker socket

For now, the docker socket is required to run Shuffle. Whether you run with Kubernetes or another clustering technology, Shuffle WILL need access to ContainerD, which is what the docker socket provides. If this is against internal policies and you want a single point of contact for controlling permissions, please have a look at [docker socket proxy](#docker_socket_proxy) farther down.

**Usage of the socket**:

* Backend (Not required, but used for app management)
* Orborus (Required, deploying Workers)
* Worker    (Required, deploying Apps. Apps DONT have access to the socket.)

**API's in use**

* Backend: Create, Make, Export docker images. No direct container management.
* Orborus: Download and Remove images. Make, List and Remove containers. Make, List and Remove services.
* Worker: Download and Remove images. Make, List and Remove containers. Make, List and Remove services.

### Docker Socket Proxy
In certain scenarios or environments, you may find the docker socket to not have the right permissions, or running the socket directly on your software to be against internal policies. To solve this problem, we've built support for the [docker socket proxy](https://github.com/Tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy), which will give the containers the same permissions, but without the socket being directly mounted in the same container. Another good reason to use the docker socket proxy is to control the docker permissions required.

To use the docker socket proxy, add the following to your docker-compose.yml as a service. This will lauch it together with the rest:
```
  docker-socket-proxy:
    image: tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy
    privileged: true
    environment:
      - SERVICES=1
      - TASKS=1
      - NETWORKS=1
      - NODES=1
      - BUILD=1
      - IMAGES=1
      - GRPC=1
      - CONTAINERS=1
      - PLUGINS=1
      - SYSTEM=1
      - VOLUMES=1
      - INFO=1
      - DISTRIBUTION=1
      - POST=1
      - AUTH=1
      - SECRETS=1
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    networks:
      - shuffle

```

When done, remove the "/var/run/docker.sock" volume from the backend and orborus services in the docker-compose. To enable the docker rerouting, add this environment variable to both of them
```
      - DOCKER_HOST=tcp://docker-socket-proxy:2375
```

This will route all docker traffic through the docker-socket-proxy giving you granular access to each API.

## Uptime Monitoring

Uptime monitoring of Shuffle can be done by periodically polling the API for userinfo located at /api/v1/getinfo. This is an API that connects to our database, and which will be stuck if we any platform issues occur, whether in your local instance or in our Cloud instance on https://shuffler.io.

Shuffle has and will not have any planned downtime for services on https://shuffler.io, and have built our architecture around being able to upgrade and roll back without any downtime at all. If this occurs in the future for our Cloud platform, we will make sure to notify any active users. We plan to launch a status monitor for our services in 2022.

**Basic monitoring** can be done with a curl request + sendmail + cronjob as [seen in this blogpost](https://www.programcreek.com/2017/06/automatically-detect-server-downtime-using-linux-cron-job/) with the curl command below. Your personal API key can be found on [https://shuffler.io/settings](https://shuffler.io/settings) or in the same location (/settings) in your local instance.

```
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/getinfo -H "Authorization: Bearer apikey"
```

### Shuffle Server Healthcheck

There are multiple things to check in the Shuffle server to ensure that the health of server is in a good state:

- Disk Space
- Memory
- Elasticsearch service state

For this, the scripts have been prepared with the alerting mechanism which will check if everything is proper or not.

### Disk Space Script

This script will determine whether or not the disc space is more than 75% full. If so, an alert will be sent to your Webhook URL. Replace the script's <Webhook-URL> with your Webhook URL.


```
#!/bin/sh
df -H | grep -vE '^Filesystem|tmpfs|cdrom' | awk '{ print $5 " " $1 }' | grep -v overlay | while read output;
do
  #echo $output
  usep=$(echo $output | awk '{ print $1}' | cut -d '%' -f1  )
  partition=$(echo $output | awk '{ print $2 }' )
  if [ $usep -ge 75 ]; then
    curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data '{"Alert":"Almost out of disk space","Server":"Local-Lab Shuffle Server"}' <Webhook-URL>
  fi
done
```

### Memory Check Script

This script will determine whether or not the memory utilization is more than 70%. If so, an alert will be sent to your Webhook URL. Replace the script's <Webhook-URL> with your Webhook URL.


```
#check server health
STATUS="$(curl http://172.17.14.102:3001/api/v1/_ah/health)"
if [ "${STATUS}" = "OK" ]; then
    :
else
    curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data '{"Alert":"There is a problem with this server(172.17.14.102), status is not OK"}' <Webhook-URL>
    exit 1
fi
```

### Elasticsearch Service Script

This script will determine whether or not the Elasticsearch service is running or not. If not so, an alert will be sent to your Webhook URL. Replace the script’s <Elasticsearch-IP> with the Elasticsearch IP of your environment. Replace the script's <Webhook-URL> with your Webhook URL.

```
#check server health
STATUS="$(curl <Elasticsearch-IP>)"
if [ "${STATUS}" = "OK" ]; then
    :
else
    curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data '{"Alert":"There is a problem with this server(172.17.14.102), status is not OK"}' <Webhook-URL>
    exit 1
fi
~
```

### Cron Jobs to automate the Process

You can set a cron job to execute the scripts on every 15 minutes and the whole process can be automated.

```
*/15 * * * * bash /root/diskspacecheck.sh
*/15 * * * * bash /root/healthchech.sh
*/15 * * * * bash /root/memorycheck.sh
```

### Using podman

Our main goal is to provide stable support for docker. But a lot of members from our community run podman (Especially because RHEL 8 uses it). We have tested Shuffle with podman and it works for most parts. While it's not our main focus, The way to run Shuffle with podman is nearly the same.

1. Make sure to remove the usage of double quotes from .env after you git clone Shuffle. This is because podman doesn't support double quotes in the .env file.

You can do it like this:



```
sed -E "s/(.*)=['\"]?([^'\"]*)['\"]?/\1=\2/" .env -i
```


2. Edit the existing docker-compose.yml to support podman by:

In shuffle-backend, comment back in the volume: /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
And in environments, Comment back out:  # DOCKER_HOST=tcp://docker-socket-proxy:2375


So that the shuffle-backend service block ends up looking like this:



```yaml
  backend:
    image: ghcr.io/shuffle/shuffle-backend:latest
    container_name: shuffle-backend
    hostname: ${BACKEND_HOSTNAME}
    # Here for debugging:
    ports:
      - "${BACKEND_PORT}:5001"
    networks:
      - shuffle
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - ${SHUFFLE_APP_HOTLOAD_LOCATION}:/shuffle-apps:z
      - ${SHUFFLE_FILE_LOCATION}:/shuffle-files:z
    env_file: .env
    environment:
      #- DOCKER_HOST=tcp://docker-socket-proxy:2375 # we commented this out
      - SHUFFLE_APP_HOTLOAD_FOLDER=/shuffle-apps
      - SHUFFLE_FILE_LOCATION=/shuffle-files
```



3. Run Shuffle with podman by:



```bash
sudo podman-compose -f docker-compose.yml pull
sudo podman-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```
