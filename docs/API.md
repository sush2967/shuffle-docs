## Introduction
Shuffle is a platform to build and execute automation [workflows](/docs/workflows). It's built API-first, and everything available on the frontend has an API endpoint. The listed API's are built and generated with our own [OpenAPI creator](/docs/apps#create_openapi_app). All API's listed are for both versions of Shuffle (cloud/onprem), unless otherwise specified. Our OpenAPI specification can be [downloaded here](https://shuffler.io/apps/edaa73d40238ee60874a853dc3ccaa6f). Below are the base URL's for the API.

**Cloud:** https://shuffler.io/api/v1

**Onprem:** https://<endpoint>:<port>/api/v1

## Authentication
Shuffle uses [Bearer auth](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/) for authentication. This means that every request you send to the API, you need to send it with the header "Authorization: Bearer <APIKEY>". If Shuffle is multi-tenancy configured, you may have multiple organizations. If you want to specify the organization to use, you may add the header "Org-Id: <ORGID>". It will otherwise use the current active organization.

While logged in, you can go to https://shuffler.io/settings or /settings in your local instance to get your APIkey. Keep this safe. 

**Get all apps example**
```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/apps -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY"
```

**Authentication failure**
Status code: 401
```json
{"success": false}
```


## Responses
Shuffle responses follow the response codes listed below. The data you can expect is mostly in the following json form, whether success or failure.

```json
{
	"success": <true/false>,
	"reason": "You failed to do something"
}
```


| Code 	 | Description   |
| ------ | ------------- |
| 200    | Successful request. Usually contains information about the success. |
| 401    | Not authorized, or an error occurred. Usually contains a reason for the error. |
| 405    | Method not allowed. We use GET/POST/PUT/DELETE |
| 500    | A backend error occurred. |

## MCP
The MCP- and Agent-API is built to handle MCP workloads when the speed and determinism of workflows is not required. This is typically in cases of analysis, long-term processing or to perform tasks you otherwise would not know how to. 

Shuffle follows the [Model Context Protocol (MCP) strictly](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro), to be as interoperable with other platforms as possible. We support both short- and long-running tasks (hours and days), including the control of agent reasoning as well as self-hosted LLM models.  The MCP system in Shuffle is built on HTTP, and is built for both cloud- and on-premises remote-controlled actions.

Shuffle version required: `>=2.2.1`. ALL MCP and Agent actions are available to look into [in the Runtime Debugger](/workflows/debug). The [frontend library Shuffle MCPs](https://security.shuffler.io/shuffle-mcp-demo) is available to be put in your platform as well.

### Run an MCP action
Runs a task using the chosen tools. In the output, `result.message` is the raw output from the MCP server, with the rest talking about time and how it ran. If it does not return within 1 minute, use the execution_id and authorization to poll for it to finish.

Supported body parameters:

- `params.reasoning = minimal/low/medium/high` - How much reasoning effort the model should use. Tokens affect this.
- `params.environment = <runtime_location>` - Which [runtime location to run actions in](/admin?tab=runtime_locations). Allows for remote-control of servers (in safe container environments).
- `params.enable_questions = true` - If you want the MCP to be able to ask questions. Requires polling `POST /api/v1/streams {"execution_id": "id", "authorization": "auth"}` and/or `GET /api/v1/notifications?type=agent_questions`
- `params.authentication_id = <specific authentication>` - If you want to use a specific authentication ID for the app(s).

Method: POST

```bash
curl localhost:5002/api/v1/mcp -d '{"method": "tools/call", "params": {"tool_name": "outlook", "input": {"text": "send me an email with the subject 'heloo'"}, "reasoning": "minimal"}}'
```

**Success response**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "allowed_actions": [
      ""
    ],
    "authorization": "28bb827f-4a9c-4d7b-8ed5-f9a0ff994a9c",
    "completed_at": 1777973989995,
    "completion_tokens": 219,
    "execution_id": "49d01bec-b10b-49ae-a639-d5e79f21652f",
    "llm_call_count": 1,
    "message": "An email has been sent. Look into the execution if you need further details.",
    "notifications": 0,
    "original_input": "send me an email with the subject 'heloo'",
    "prompt_tokens": 1293,
    "started_at": 1777973989995,
    "status": "FINISHED",
    "total_tokens": 1512
  }
}
```

### Run an agent action
Running the agent action is the EXACT same as the MCP API, with the only difference being that it responds immediately with the execution ID and authorization instead of waiting for the full execution to finish. After getting the execution_id and authorization, you can call `POST /api/v1/streams {"execution_id": "id", "authorization": "auth"}` to poll for it finishing. This has no timeout. 

Method: POST

```bash
curl localhost:5002/api/v1/agent -d '{"method": "tools/call", "params": {"tool_name": "outlook", "input": {"text": "send me an email with the subject 'heloo'"}, "reasoning": "minimal"}}'
```

**Success response**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "execution_id": "49d01bec-b10b-49ae-a639-d5e79f21652f",
  "authorization": "28bb827f-4a9c-4d7b-8ed5-f9a0ff994a9c"
}
```


### Ping
Validates if the Shuffle Agent & MCP system is available or not

Method: POST

```bash
curl localhost:5002/api/v1/mcp -d '{"id": 1337, "method": "ping"}'
```

**Success response**
```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1337,"result":{"timestamp":"2026-05-05T09:21:03Z","uptime":3600}}
```

### Listing available tools
Lists the most used actions within an App using the `tools/list` Method. Works for a single app. 

If you want a specific app ID, use `tool_id`. This works with private apps as well:

- `params.tool_id = <app ID>`

Method: POST

```bash
curl localhost:5002/api/v1/mcp -d '{"id": 1337, "method": "tools/list", "params": {"tool_name": "outlook"}}'
```

**Success response**
```json

## Workflow API
Workflows are used to execute your automations, and has endpoints related to creation, triggers, saving and deleting, aborting and listing.

### List all workflows
Return a list of all existing workflows. 

Disable truncating (since 2.0.2)**: Add the `truncate=false` header, and we will directly return the list without modifications IF it is less than 32Mb in size. 
We may otherwise truncate the data, and add the `X-SHUFFLE_TRUNCATED=true` response header if the data is sufficiently large.

Method: GET

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/workflows -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY"
```


### List workflow runs
Returns a list of executions for a given workflow. Use "top=10" to get 10 last results. Use "cursor=<cursor>" to get next page.

Method: GET

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/workflows/{workflow_id}/executions -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY"
```

**Success response**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "executions": [],
  "cursor": "cursor"
}
```

### List workflow executions (old)
Returns a list of executions for a given workflow

Method: GET

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/workflows/{workflow_id}/executions -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY"
```

**Success response**

```json
[]
```


### Get a workflow
Returns a given workflow. This is the same as exporting the workflow.

Method: GET

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/workflows/{workflow_id} -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY"
```

### Upload a Workflow

**Method:** `POST`

To download a single workflow, provide the full repository path to the specific workflow file.  
To download all workflows from a repository, provide the repository base URL.

The `Org-Id` header is optional. If specified, the workflow(s) will be downloaded and imported into the given organization. If Org-Id not provided then they will be imported into the user’s currently active organization.

If the Git provider is already configured at the organization, `username` and `password` is optional in the body. In such cases, the Shuffle will use the credentials configured for that organization.

Currently, the following Git providers are supported:
- GitHub  
- GitLab  
- Bitbucket  
- Azure DevOps

```bash
curl -X POST "{BASE_URL}/api/v1/workflows/download_remote" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Org-Id: <ORG_ID>" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://example.com/repo/path/workflow.json",
    "branch": "main",
    "username": "git-user",
    "password": "PAT"
  }'
```

### Create new workflow
Creates a basic workflow with a given name and description. Returns a startpoint for a workflow. 

Method: POST

```bash
curl -XPOST https://shuffler.io/api/v1/workflows -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY" -d '{"name": "Example API workflow", "description": "Description for the workflow"}'
```

**Success response**

```json
{"actions":[],"branches":[],"triggers":[],"schedules":null,"id":"25cb3cc6-f343-4511-827f-b60557043327","is_valid":true,"name":"Example API workflow","description":"Description for the workflow","start":"","owner":"4669463f-f98e-4d86-891d-76edac4356c6","sharing":"private","execution_org":{"name":"","org":"","users":null,"id":""},"workflow_variables":null}
```


### Save a workflow
Saves a workflow with a given WORKFLOW_ID. Requires WORKFLOW_ID from [Create new workflow](/docs/API#create_new_workflow) to match in the parameter and the data sent.

**PS: This function is destructive and does not check everything, but will return if there are missing apps or similar**

Method: PUT

```bash
curl -XPUT https://shuffler.io/api/v1/workflows/WORKFLOW_ID -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY" --data '{"actions":[],"branches":[],"triggers":[],"schedules":null,"id":"WORKFLOW_ID","is_valid":true,"name":"Example workflow","description":"Description for the workflow","start":"","owner":"4669463f-f98e-4d86-891d-76edac4356c6","sharing":"private","execution_org":{"name":"","org":"","users":null,"id":""},"workflow_variables":null}'
```

**Success response** 
```json
{"success": true}
```


### Delete a workflow
Deletes a workflow with a given ID.

Method: DELETE

```bash
curl -XDELETE https://shuffler.io/api/v1/workflows/apcb3cc6-f343-4511-827f-b60557043327 -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY" 
```

**Success response** 

```json
{"success": true}
```


### Execute workflow
Executes a given workflow with optional arguments "execution_argument" and "start". Start is an optional node to start from. [See Additional Optional Arguments](https://github.com/Shuffle/shuffle-shared/blob/57b211816d87b47acde1481084b187fda13d05ba/structs.go#L126).

Methods: POST, GET

```bash
curl -XPOST https://shuffler.io/api/v1/workflows/{workflow_id}/execute -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY" -d '{
	"execution_argument": "DATA TO EXECUTE WITH",
	"start": ""
}'
```

Additional info:
- If you don't send JSON to the API, but a random string, we will take the entire string as the execution argument.
- You can add dynamic app authentication when starting a workflow by using the following header: 'appauth'. Example: 'appauth: jira=auth for jira;elasticsearch=elasticsearch auth'. This works both with the name of the auth, and the ID.
- If you want to run the workflow with a different environment, use the "environment" header with the name. Example: 'environment: cloud'. The environment needs to be the name of an existing environment.

**Success response** 

```json
{"success": true, "execution_id": "6e58639e-a24f-4af8-b62b-d6fcc2bc10f4", "authorization": "26fb304f-92c9-4ca5-9735-9173ce80569e"}
```


### Get execution results
Gets an execution based on results from [Execute workflow](/docs/api#execute_workflow). Requires execution_id and authorization parameters. You can only use the authorization key in the data itself to get the ID, not in the header. To track progress, call this every few seconds and look for updates to "results" (json["results"]).

Methods: POST

```bash
curl -XPOST https://shuffler.io/api/v1/streams/results -d '{
	"execution_id": "ad9baac7-dc30-42da-bb1f-18b84309cfb7",
	"authorization": "62b3de56-9de0-4983-ad72-e63c42d123f8"
}'
```

**Success response** 

```json
{"type":"workflow","status":"ABORTED","start":"","execution_argument":"DATA TO EXECUTE WITH","execution_id":"ad9baac7-dc30-42da-bb1f-18b84309cfb7","workflow_id":"8f3c6a10-f5ca-432c-aef9-c5e038166c45","last_node":"","authorization":"62b3de56-9de0-4983-ad72-e63c42d123f8","result":"","started_at":1591074812,"completed_at":1591074857,"project_id":"shuffle","locations":["europe-west2"],"workflow":{"actions":[{"app_name":"testing","app_version":"1.0.0","app_id":"c567fc10-9c15-403e-b72c-6550e9e76bc8","errors":null,"id":"de10798e-2c66-4e0c-bfdd-8b645a8e3748","is_valid":true,"isStartNode":true,"sharing":true,"private_id":"","label":"testing_1","small_image":"","large_image":"","environment":"Shuffle","name":"repeat_back_to_me","parameters":[{"description":"message to repeat","id":"","name":"call","example":"","value":"232.21.10.12","multiline":true,"action_field":"","variant":"STATIC_VALUE","required":true,"schema":{"type":"string"}}],"position":{"x":-326.750381666118,"y":52.50022245682308},"priority":0},{"app_name":"Virustotal","app_version":"1.0.0","app_id":"e5d625cee91f5f8328f2f4ef09ef313e","errors":null,"id":"bdec0a1c-381c-4e90-ba04-db40db98406c","is_valid":true,"isStartNode":false,"sharing":false,"private_id":"e5d625cee91f5f8328f2f4ef09ef313e","label":"Virustotal_1","small_image":"","large_image":"","environment":"Shuffle","name":"get_ip_report","parameters":[{"description":"The apikey to use","id":"","name":"apikey","example":"","value":"","multiline":false,"action_field":"VT APIKEY","variant":"WORKFLOW_VARIABLE","required":true,"schema":{"type":"string"}},{"description":"Generated by shuffler.io OpenAPI","id":"","name":"ip","example":"","value":"128.0.0.11","multiline":false,"action_field":"","variant":"STATIC_VALUE","required":true,"schema":{"type":"string"}}],"position":{"x":-657.9998647811465,"y":52.000953074820615},"priority":0}],"branches":[{"destination_id":"bdec0a1c-381c-4e90-ba04-db40db98406c","id":"7ad84769-3e7f-48af-af73-802bc93b5c2c","source_id":"de10798e-2c66-4e0c-bfdd-8b645a8e3748","label":"","has_errors":false,"conditions":null}],"triggers":null,"schedules":null,"id":"8f3c6a10-f5ca-432c-aef9-c5e038166c45","is_valid":true,"name":"VT testing","description":"Helo","start":"de10798e-2c66-4e0c-bfdd-8b645a8e3748","owner":"4669463f-f98e-4d86-891d-76edac4356c6","sharing":"private","execution_org":{"name":"","org":"","users":null,"id":""},"workflow_variables":[{"description":"","id":"ec16e9a6-5d13-46ba-8613-ebf301569f44","name":"VT APIKEY","value":""}]},"results":null}
```


### Abort workflow

Aborts an execution based on a WORKFLOW_ID and EXECUTION_ID. Can only be done while the status is "EXECUTING".

Methods: GET

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/workflows/{workflow_id}/executions/{execution_id}/abort -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY"
```

**Success response** 

```json
{"success": true}
```

## Datastore API
Datastore is a persistent storage mechanism you can use for workflows to talk to each other between executions, or for normal storage. Below are the endpoints related to datastore (cache) creation, listing, deletion and more. This API is available to Python apps by using self.set_cache("key", "value", category="category") and self.get_cache("key", category="category")

### Set a key
Add a key to the Shuffle Datastore (previously called `cache`). To add a key to a specific category, add `"category": "name"` to the JSON body. The `value` field can be anything, but preferrably JSON. You can add Enrichments using the `enrichments` field with the format `[{"type": "ip", "value": 1.2.3.4"}]` which is used heavily in Shuffle Security. `ignore_security_rules` is only relevant IF you have enabled security rules for the category you are in, which restricts who and what can write to a key.

Methods: POST, PUT

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/orgs/{org_id}/set_cache -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY" -d '{"key":"hi", "value":"1234", "category": "category", "ignore_security_rules": false}'
```


**Success response** 
```json
{"success": true, "keys_existed": [{"key": "hi", "existed": true }]}
```

### Set multiple keys
Accepts a list in the same format as [Set a key](#set_a_key), and is very efficient at bulk updates. Returns which keys are new and which were updated. To add a key to a specific category, add `"category": "name"` to the JSON body. **PS:** Only keys of the first discovered category will be added.

Methods: POST, PUT

```bash

## App API
Apps are the building blocks used in [workflows](/docs/apps#workflows), as they contain the actions to be executed. First of all, there are two types of apps:

* Generated from OpenAPI
* Self-made with Python

Here's how to distinguish them for now:
* OpenAPI: app.activated & app.generated = true, and app.private_id length > 0
* Normal: Opposite of OpenAPI

### Get apps
Returns a list of existing apps that you have access to, including private ones.

Methods: GET

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/apps -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY"
```

### Delete an app 
Deletes an app if you have access to delete it.

Methods: DELETE

```bash
curl -XDELETE https://shuffler.io/api/v1/apps/{app_id} -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY"
```

### Upload a python app 
Uploads a python app. You should upload a zip file with the following like file structure. This has to be done for each individual version of the app. The app uploaded is available to everyone in the organization.

If you need help with this section, [look into the Shuffle CLI utility as well](https://github.com/Shuffle/shufflecli). 

To zip an app, go to the appfolder, e.g. shuffle-tools, then type in the following to zip the version you want to upload (\*nix):
```
zip app.zip -r version/*
```

This will give you the following structure.
``` 
app.zip
├── src
│   ├── app.py
├── api.yaml
├── Dockerfile
├── requirements.txt
```       

Methods: POST

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/apps/upload -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY" -F 'shuffle_file=@./your_file/file_path/app.zip'
```
**Success response** 
```json
{"success": true, "id": "798f1234c4fb8b4a6300da3c546af45a"}
```

The ID returned is based on these fields being unique: 
- Organization
- App Name
- App ID

After an app is uploaded, the App cache for your Organization is cleared, meaning your apps will be loaded from the database directly. 
If you want to see whether your app was uploaded or not, you can always check the app directly here (swap appid): https://shuffler.io/apps/{appid}

## Stats and Timelines
Stats and Timelines are a system built to help track changes to something over time. This is used both by internal systems in Shuffle, and is an option for you to use in Workflows or elsewhere to make timelines. Adding statistics was added in versions >1.4.3, and graphing of ANY value will be available soon. Graphs for default tracked information like App and Workflow utilisation is on the [statistics admin page for your Organisation](https://shuffler.io/admin?admin_tab=billing). 

The [new dashboard page allows for customisation of a bar graph](/new-dashboard). You may view your custom stats here. We will introduce custom dashboard controls in future versions of Shuffle.

      "daily_value": 113
    }
  ]
}
```

### Count Stats for Custom key 
Add a statistic to be added, e.g. for number of tickets found over time. Custom statistics are tracked under the key "custom_X", where "custom_" is appended unless supplied, and "X" is the key you supply. They can be found in the "additions" section of the Get Stats API response.

Use the "Count Stats" action in Shuffle tools to do this in a Workflow 

Method: POST

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/orgs/{ORG_ID}/stats  -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY" -d '{"key": "tickets", "value": 6}'
```

**Success response**
```json
{"success": true, "reason": "Cache incremented by 6"}
```

## App Authentication
App Authentication is a way to store authentication keys encrypted and safe, available through using their ID. You can interact with it through a workflow, an app or the admin panel at /admin?tab=app_auth. To use an authentication after it's made, it has to be mapped to an action in a workflow by it's ID.

Here is a brief video that you can watch to learn more about it:




[![App Authentication video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/LoDaAmHDhFg/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoDaAmHDhFg)



	
### List App Authentication
Get a list of all app authentication. These are all the authentication currently available to YOUR organization. These can be distributed from Parent org to Child org.

Methods: GET

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/apps/authentication -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY"
```

**Success response** 
```json
{"success": true, "data": []}
```

### Set Authentication Everywhere
When you have an authentication available, it is possible to set it everywhere using an API. This will update all your current workflows that uses that app to use the specified authentication. This can also be done while creating an app authentication by setting the field `"auto_distribute": true` in the json

Methods: POST

```bash
curl -XPOST https://shuffler.io/api/v1/apps/authentication/{authentication_id}/config -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY" -d '{"action"
: "assign_everywhere", "id": "authentication_id"}'
```

**Success response**
```json
{"success": true}
```

### Allow suborgs to use auth
Parent organizations have the option to allow child orgs to use the same auth. The suborgs can not modify the auth they get access to. Intended for use where you e.g. have one ticketing system as an MSSP which you want to create tickets in from your child orgs (customers).

Methods: POST

```bash
curl -XPOST https://shuffler.io/api/v1/apps/authentication/{authentication_id}/config -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY" -d '{"action"
: "suborg_distribute", "id": "authentication_id"}'
```

**Success response**
```json
{"success": true}
```

### Delete App Authentication
Delete an authentication. PS: This does NOT change the ID of every workflow that utilizes the app.

Methods: DELETE

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/apps/authentication/{authentication_id} -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY"
```

**Success response** 
```json
{"success": true}
```

### Add App Authentication
Add authentication to an app, available through e.g. the Workflow editor, or authentication explorer. When adding this, make sure the app has an ID (uuid) and name attached to it, and that the fields are matching the apps' description.

You can find the fields following these steps:
1. Get the app you want to use (e.g. Jira)
2. Find a sample Action (doesn't matter which)
3. Loop through the Action's parameter's and find fields tagged with `"configuration": true`

**If you want it auto distributed to all existing workflows in your org, add `"auto_distribute": true` to the JSON body**

Method: PUT

```bash
curl -XPUT https://shuffler.io/api/v1/apps/authentication -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY" '{
	"label":"Auth for Jira",
	"app": {
		"name":"Jira",
		"id":"1836c9786bb54748bd8913c0617d50fd",
		"app_version":"1.0.0"
	}, "fields":[
		{"key":"username_basic","value":"asd"},
		{"key":"password_basic","value":"qwe"},
		{"key":"url","value":"https://api-url"}
	],
	"active":true
}'
```

**Success response** 
```json
{"success": true, "id": "app_id"}
```

### Search existing apps 
Returns a list of apps that are hidden in the backend, e.g. OpenAPI apps loaded from [Security API's](https://github.com/frikky/OpenAPI-security-definitions). Requires the search parameter. 

Example: {"search": "secure"} will match both "secureworks" and "Cisco openVuln", because Secureworks has "secure" in its name and Cisco uses "secure" in its description.

Methods: POST

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/apps/search -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY" -d '{"search": "APPNAME"}'
```

**Success response** 
```json
{"success": true, "reason": [{apps here}]}

**Success response** 
```json
{"success": true}
```

### Edit an existing file
Edit an active file with existing content (/upload) for first uploads. The file meta is left intact, except for the hash sums, sizing and timestamps. This function is meant to be used together with [file categories](#get_file_category) to e.g. handle Detection rules.

Methods: PUT

```bash
curl -XPUT https://shuffler.io/api/v1/files/{id}/edit -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY" -d 'this is the new content of the file'
```


**Success response** 
```json
{"success": true}
```

### Get file category
Gets all files in a namespace zipped. The point of this function is to be able to load in multiple files at once in order to e.g. run detections. By adding the query ids=true, it will instead give you a list of all the files. When receiveing file it will automatically deduplicate files with the same Sha256 hash.

Methods: GET

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/files/namespaces/{category} -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY"
```

**?id=true**
```json

```json
{"success":true}
```


### Get all notifications
Get all notifications assigned to your user from your organizations. 

Methods: GET 

Available queries:
- status: open => only returns open
- type: agent_question => only returns notifications of type 'agent_question' 
- severity: MEDIUM => only returns "MEDIUM" severity

Queries can be mixed for better filtering.

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/notifications?status=open -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY"

## Detection API
Below are the endpoints related to manage detections in the Shuffle platform. The Detection APIs are based on the [File API in Shuffle](#file-api), but has some custom management interfaces to make it easier to use. The primary area this is currently used heavily is in [Shuffle Security](https://security.shuffler.io/detection).

The detection system is both used for internal Detection, as well as for distributed third party detection management in multiple environments simultaneously.

If you want to know more about these endpoints, reach out to [support@shuffler.io](mailto:support@shuffler.io). 

## Singul
The Integration Layer of Shuffle, [also named Singul](https://singul.io), is a way to interact with apps a new way. It utilizes Apps and MCPs that are auto-generated, auto-Categorized and auto-Labeled, and gives access to API's for specific actions for each of those labels. The integration layer is based on [Shuffle's Schemaless translation technology](https://github.com/frikky/schemaless), with the goal of making Shuffle able to act as a Large **Action** Model (LAM).

[A frontend library is also available to handle integrations in your own platform. Learn more here.](https://security.shuffler.io/shuffle-mcp-demo)

<img width="713" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Shuffle/Shuffle-docs/assets/5719530/e806707d-9635-465b-8040-b3e26b1786a0">

### Shufflepy
The easiest way to try it out for developer is to [use the Shufflepy library](https://github.com/frikky/schemaless). 

```python
from shufflepy import Shuffle

## If the url is not specified, the library will use `https://shuffler.io` as the default URL. You must specify an apikey. 

shuffle = Singul("APIKEY")
resp = shuffle.list_tickets("jira")
```
		
### Run a Category Action
Runs the category action in a standardized format.
	
Methods: POST 

```bash
curl -XPOST https://shuffler.io/api/v1/apps/categories/run -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY" -d '{
	"app_name": "PagerDuty",
	"category": "cases",
	"label": "create_ticket",
	"fields": [{
		"key": "title",
		"value": "This is the title"
	}, {
		"key": "description",
		"value": "This is the description"
	}, {
		"key": "source",
		"value": "Shuffle"
	}],
	"skip_workflow": true
}'
```

**Success response** 
**200** means the app ran and performed both input and output translation properly
```json
Default Label Output
```

**202** means the app ran, but the output translation failed. This will return the DEFAULT output of the action that ran.

**Other status codes**: They are based on the API from the app itself, and indicates something went wrong.

### Get Active Categories
To find what categories with what apps you have that are active, run this API. It will return with what categories and actions for those categories you have available. This is based on the current organization.
	
Methods: GET 

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/apps/categories -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY"
```


**Success response** 
```json
[{
	"name":"Cases",
	"color":"",
	"icon":"cases",
	"action_labels":["Create ticket"],
	"app_labels": [{
		"app_name":"PagerDuty",
		"large_image":"",
		"id":"50af6d9f18134b90aabca9180b37ea01",
		"labels": [{
			"category":"Cases",
			"label":"Create ticket"
		}]
	}]
}]
```


### How to debug Singul executions
- Go to https://shuffler.io/workflows/debug
- You should see something like this:


<img src="https://github.com/frikky/shuffle-docs/blob/master/assets/singul-debugger.png?raw=true"> 


As you can see, I triggered this Singul execution through the Singul app (not the SDK). However, even if you were using the SDK, you would find such executions.

- Click on the icon below "Explore":

<img src="https://github.com/frikky/shuffle-docs/blob/master/assets/explore-singul.png?raw=true">

- You will see the full result of the execution. Click on the arrow

<img src="https://github.com/frikky/shuffle-docs/blob/master/assets/singul-debugging-step1.png?raw=true">

- To see the body that Singul translated to, scroll and find the "Body" 

<img src="https://github.com/frikky/shuffle-docs/blob/master/assets/singul-debugging-step2.png?raw=true">


Based on the output, and the input mentioned in "Body", you should be able to figure out what is going on here.
